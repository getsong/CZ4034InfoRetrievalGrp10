How do great coaches turn a collection of individuals into a coherent \u201cus\u201d?&nbsp;&nbsp;Seth Davis, one of the keenest minds in sports journalism, has been thinking about that question for twenty-five years. It\u2019s one of the things that drove him to write the definitive biography of college basketball\u2019s greatest coach, John Wooden,&nbsp;Wooden: A Coach\u2019s Life. But John Wooden coached a long time ago. The world has changed, and coaching has too, tremendously. Seth Davis decided to embark on a proper investigation to get to the root of the matter.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Getting to Us, Davis probes and prods the best of the best from the landscape of active coaches of football and basketball, college and pro\u2014from Urban Meyer, Dabo Swinney, and Jim Harbaugh to Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo, Jim Boeheim, Brad Stevens, Geno Auriemma, and Doc Rivers\u2014to get at the fundamental ingredients of greatness in the coaching sphere. There\u2019s no single right way, of course\u2014part of the great value of this book is Davis\u2019s distillation of what he has learned about different types of greatness in coaching, and what sort of leadership thrives in one kind of environment but not in others. Some coaches have thrived at the college level but not in the pros. Why? What\u2019s the difference? Some coaches are stern taskmasters, others are warm and cuddly; some are brilliant strategists but less emotionally involved with their players, and with others it\u2019s vice versa. In&nbsp;Getting to Us, we come to feel a deep connection with the most successful and iconic coaches in all of sports\u2014big winners and big characters, whose stories offer much of enduring interest and value.",

Known as one of the hardest-working and highest-achieving players in NBA history, this most dedicated competitor was legendary for his sharp shooting. From the Outside,&nbsp;complete with a foreword by Spike Lee,&nbsp;is his story in his words: a no-holds-barred look at his life and career, filled with behind-the-scenes stories and surprising revelations about the game he has always cherished.Allen talks openly about his fellow players, coaches, owners, and friends, including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Garnett. He reveals how, as a kid growing up in a military family, he learned about responsibility and respect\u2014the key to making those perfect free throws and critical three-point shots.From the Outside is the portrait of a gifted athlete and a serious man with a strongly defined philosophy about the game and the right way it should be played\u2014a philosophy that, at times, set him apart from colleagues and coaches, while inspiring so many others, and lead to the most pivotal shot of his career: the unforgettable 3-pointer in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals against the San Antonio Spurs. Throughout, Allen makes clear that success in basketball is as much about what happens off the court as on, that devotion and commitment are the true essence of the game\u2014and of life itself.",

Masterfully assembled by longtime Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, Basketball spans eight decades to bring together a dream team of writers as awe-inspiring and endlessly inventive as the game itself. Here are in-depth profiles of the legends of the hardcourt--Russell, Kareem, Bird, Jordan, and LeBron--and storied franchises such as the Knicks and Celtics, along with dazzling portraits of the flash and sizzle of playground ball and more personal reflections on the game by some of America's finest writers, among them Donald Hall, John Edgar Wideman, and Pat Conroy. Highlights include James Naismith recalling how he invented the game that would go on to conquer the world; John McPhee capturing the ever-disciplined Bill Bradley as a Princeton Tiger; Peter Goldman's indelible portrait of the life and death of a Harlem Globetrotter; and Michael Lewis's account of the brave new world of NBA analytics. Classic journalism about inner-city basketball by Pete Axthelm, Rick Telander, and Darcy Frey is joined by stories of the game's popularity across America, from the heartland of Hoosier country to an Apache Reservation in Arizona.Cover: Copyright \u00a9 1996 by NBAE.

    "product_name": "Old School Grit: Times May Change, But the Rules for Success Never Do (Sports for the Soul) (Volume 2)",
    "description": "The 15 Unbreakable Rules for Building Grit and Achieving Your Dreams! Psychologists tell us that the secret to a successful and happy life, more than anything else, is something called GRIT. Defined as the willpower to persevere with passion and a sense of purpose, research shows that grit is what matters most in whether a person succeeds or fails. That same research shows that previous generations had a lot more grit than today\u2019s younger generations. This isn\u2019t surprising. After all, most of us would agree that those older, wiser, and tougher members of the Greatest Generation are prime examples of what it means to persevere, to never back down, and to make sacrifices for a greater purpose. We could all use more of the OLD SCHOOL GRIT they embraced. In this inspirational fable, Bob Flanagan represents the voice of old school grit. A legendary college basketball coach who thinks like John Wooden and talks like Mike Ditka, Flanagan is entering the final days of his coaching career. While his team tries to advance through the NCAA postseason tournament, Flanagan uses his last days as a coach to write his grandchildren letters revealing the rules for a successful and happy life. The rules of grit. Though Coach Flanagan\u2019s letters are intended for his grandchildren, they might as well be for America in general. This is a man who lives by the old school code of faith, family, courage, and character; and he believes too many people have gone soft these days. They give up on their dreams too easily. They whine, complain, and pass the blame. They spend all their time and energy trying to avoid challenges instead of bucking up and powering through them. Flanagan\u2019s letters are a rallying cry for toughening up and building grit. His fifteen rules provide a clear path to success in any endeavor.  Consider this book an instruction manual for getting back to the values that truly lead to success and developing the type of old school grit that will get you through anything.",

It turned out to be the right choice, as Alcindor and his teammates won an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles. But it also marked the beginning of one of the most extraordinary and enduring friendships in the history of sports. In COACH WOODEN AND ME, Abdul-Jabbar reveals the inspirational story of how his bond with John Wooden evolved from a history-making coach-player mentorship into a deep and genuine friendship that transcended sports, shaped the course of both men's lives, and lasted for half a century.COACH WOODEN AND ME is a stirring tribute to the subtle but profound influence that Wooden had on Kareem as a player, and then as a person, as they began to share their cultural, religious, and family values while facing some of life's biggest obstacles. From his first day of practice, when the players were taught the importance of putting on their athletic socks properly, to gradually absorbing the sublime wisdom of Coach Wooden's now famous \"Pyramid of Success\"; to learning to cope with the ugly racism that confronted black athletes during the turbulent Civil Rights era as well as losing loved ones, Abdul-Jabbar fondly recalls how Coach Wooden's fatherly guidance not only paved the way for his unmatched professional success but also made possible a lifetime of personal fulfillment.Full of intimate, never-before-published details and delivered with the warmth and erudition of a grateful student who has learned his lessons well, COACH WOODEN AND ME is at once a celebration of the unique philosophical outlook of college basketball's most storied coach and a moving testament to the all-conquering power of friendship.",

Even more important, he succeeded in never wavering from coaching his way, from a place of deep values. Jackson was tagged as the \u201cZen master\u201d half in jest by sportswriters, but the nickname speaks to an important truth: this is a coach who inspired, not goaded; who led by awakening and challenging the better angels of his players\u2019 nature, not their egos, fear, or greed. This is the story of a preacher\u2019s kid from North Dakota who grew up to be one of the most innovative leaders of our time. In his quest to reinvent himself, Jackson explored everything from humanistic psychology and Native American philosophy to Zen meditation. In the process, he developed a new approach to leadership based on freedom, authenticity, and selfless teamwork that turned the hypercompetitive world of professional sports on its head. In Eleven Rings, Jackson candidly describes how he:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Learned the secrets of mindfulness and team chemistry while playing for the champion New York Knicks in the 1970s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Managed Michael Jordan, the greatest player in the world, and got him to embrace selflessness, even if it meant losing a scoring title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Forged successful teams out of players of varying abilities by getting them to trust one another and perform in sync&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Inspired Dennis Rodman and other \u201cuncoachable\u201d personalities to devote themselves to something larger than themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Transformed Kobe Bryant from a rebellious teenager into a mature leader of a championship team.Eleven times, Jackson led his teams to the ultimate goal: the NBA championship\u2014six times with the Chicago Bulls and five times with the Los Angeles Lakers.

The only problem: no one knew who Krzyzewski was. Nine&nbsp;days later, Jim Valvano was hired by North Carolina State to be their new head coach. The hiring didn't raise as many eyebrows, but the two new coaches had a similar goal: to unseat North Carolina's Dean Smith as the king of college basketball. And just like that, the most sensational competitive decade in history was about to unfold. In the skillful hands of John Feinstein, The Legends Club captures an era in American sport and culture, documenting the inside view of a decade of absolutely incredible competition. Feinstein pulls back the curtain on the recruiting wars, the intensely personal competition that wasn't always friendly, the enormous pressure and national stakes, and the battle for the very soul of college basketball.",

A lifelong Warriors fan turned insider Thompson is uniquely qualified to tell the definitive story of a singular talent, pulling back the curtain on the crazy work ethic and on-court intensity that make Curry great\u2014and the emphasis on family and faith that keeps him grounded.  Combining the competitive grit and fun-loving spirit of his mother with the mild demeanor, easy charm, and sharp shooting of his father, former NBA player Dell Curry, Steph Curry derives support and strength from his close-knit kin and his commitment to Christianity. This hard-working, wholesome image however is both a blessing and curse in a League of big personalities. Thompson unravels the complicated underpinnings of the Steph Curry hate with a nuanced analysis of how class and complexion come into play when a child with an NBA pedigree becomes the face of a sport traditionally honed on inner-city black top and dominated by the less privileged. With unprecedented access, Thompson draws from exclusive interviews with Steph Curry, his family, his teammates, Coach Steve Kerr, and the Warriors owners to bring readers inside the locker room and courtside with this remarkable athlete and man.",

    "description": "WE CHANGED THE GAME is a story-the real story-about the very beginning of the Indiana Pacers professional basketball team. It's about the laughable new league founded in the 1960's in which the Pacers got their start as a team, the American Basketball Association (ABA), which gave many unsung players a shot or a second chance to make it in pro basketball but faced constant struggles during its brief existence from 1967-1976 before it merged with the NBA. During those early days in the ABA league, the Indiana Pacers captured three ABA league championship titles. But also-and only known by a select few-the Pacers, and the ABA league as a whole, barely survived through some incredibly close calls and financial fiascos, facing the brink of extinction more than once. But it was with the unwavering support of Pacers fans, very creative negotiating by Pacers' co-founder and team protector Richard Tinkham, an ABA-NBA league merger, and two Indianapolis-based real estate legends that ultimately saved the ABA and secured the Pacers' future as one of the top-contending professional basketball teams in the country. The love that Indiana basketball fans had for the Pacers also triggered the explosion of downtown Indianapolis, transforming it into a vibrant, progressive state capital over these past 50 years. Through the eyes of Robin Miller, Richard Tinkham and Bob Netolicky who were there through it all, sit back and enjoy one of the most improbable and inspirational stories in professional sports history. The Pacers and the ABA league proved that with big dreams, loyalty and perseverance, even the impossible really can be possible... and ordinary people truly can change the game.",

He practiced and practiced, but by the time he was fifteen, he realized there was no place for a slow, white Jewish kid in the NBA. So he found another way to channel his obsession with sports: talking trash.  In This Book Has Balls, Rapaport uses his signature smack-talk style and in-your-face humor to discuss everything from why LeBron will never be like Mike, that Tiger needs the ladies to get his golf game back, and how he once thought Mary Lou Retton was his true love. And, of course, why next year will be the year the New York Knicks win the championship. This book is a series of rants\u2014some controversial, some affectionate, but all incredibly hilarious.",

    "description": "Learn the Inspiring Story of the Milwaukee Bucks' Rising Star Giannis Antetokounmpo! Read on your PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet or Kindle device. This holiday season, if you buy the print edition as a gift, you can keep the Kindle edition for yourself! In Giannis Antetokounmpo: The Inspiring Story of One of Basketball's Rising Superstars, you will learn the inspirational story of one of basketball's most promising young stars, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Often nicknamed \"The Greek Freak\", Giannis Antetokounmpo has quickly emerged as one of the most unique players in the league today. His incredible wingspan and athleticism have made him a dominant presence on both the offensive and defensive ends of the basketball court. He is easily one of the most difficult defensive assignments for opposing teams due to his ability to not only start as a forward, but also as a guard. In just four years, Giannis Antetokounmpo has gone from averaging 6.8 points per game to 22.9 points per game. He has also quickly become the face of the Milwaukee Bucks franchise. There is still much to be unveiled in the career of Giannis Antetokounmpo. At the time of this writing, Giannis is just twenty-two years old. In this book, we'll learn more about The Greek Freak's journey into the NBA, his impact on the game, and his growing legacy as one of the best up and coming stars to make his presence known in basketball. Here is a preview of what is inside this book: Childhood and Early Life NBA Career: Getting Drafted, Rookie Season, Working Under Jason Kidd, The Largest Point Guard in the League, and Becoming an All-Star International Career Personal Life Giannis Antetokounmpo's Player Profile and Impact on Basketball Antetokounmpo's Future  An excerpt from the book: The NBA loves those rags to riches stories about how a person that lived and grew up through poverty worked his way up to get to the league, not only as an ordinary player, but a superstar ranking among the best in the world. These are the kinds of stories that makes the people adore the player and what he has been through to get to the top. More importantly, these are the stories that inspire young children to work just as hard, if not harder, than their idol to reach the success they aspire to achieve.   Several of the greatest players in league history have had to endure poverty before they found success in the NBA. Allen Iverson barely had a home growing up before he starred at Georgetown. In his MVP speech back in 2014, Kevin Durant said that his mother raised him and his brother alone while the family moved from roof to roof. The same was true for LeBron James, who was raised alone by his mother when she was still 16 years old. These players not only earned millions as NBA superstars, but have also become fan favorites because of how they worked themselves up to get to the league.  Likewise, the NBA has also found a liking for players that were seemingly genetically engineered to dominate in the game of basketball. These are the types of players that, at a glance, were naturally destined to be a great because of the physical tools they possess. If the NBA was a horse race, these kinds of players are your thoroughbreds judging by how much more physically gifted and talented they are than the rest of the competition.

For Auriemma, life affords only the briefest moments of happiness - a good round of golf, forty minutes of great basketball, a day at the beach with his family, a nice glass of wine - while disaster is seemingly always waiting to strike.

    "description": "Today basketball is played \u201cabove the rim\u201d by athletes of all backgrounds and colors. But 50 years ago it was a floor-bound game, and the opportunities it offered for African-Americans were severely limited.A key turning point was 1963, when the Loyola Ramblers of Chicago took the NCAA men\u2019s basketball title from Cincinnati, the two-time defending champions. It was one of Chicago\u2019s most memorable sports victories, but Ramblers reveals it was also a game for the history books because of the transgressive lineups fielded by both teams.Ramblers is an entertaining, detail-rich look back at the unlikely circumstances that led to Loyola\u2019s historic championship and the stories of two Loyola opponents: Cincinnati and Mississippi State. Michael Lenehan\u2019s narrative masterfully intertwines these stories in dramatic fashion, culminating with the tournament\u2019s final game, a come-from-behind overtime upset that featured two buzzer-beating shots.While on the surface this is a book about basketball, it goes deeper to illuminate how sport in America both typifies and drives change in the broader culture. The stark social realities of the times are brought vividly to life in Lenehan\u2019s telling, illustrating the challenges faced in teams\u2019 efforts simply to play their game against the worthiest opponents.",

    "description": "The definitive portrait of Kobe Bryant, from the author of Michael Jordan.  \"Lazenby's detailed research and fantastic writing paint a complex, engaging picture of one of the NBA's greats.\" (Kurt Helin, Pro Basketball Talk, NBC Sports)  Eighteen-time All-Star, scorer of 81 points in a single game, MVP, and one of the best shooting guards in NBA league history: Kobe Bryant is among basketball's absolute greatest players, and his importance to the sport is undeniable. Third on the NBA career scoring list and owner of five championship rings, he is an undisputed all-time great, one deserving of this deep and definitive biography. Even within the flashiest franchise in all of sports--the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played his entire career--Bryant always took center stage, and his final game captivated the basketball world, indeed the country. Roland Lazenby delves deep to look behind this public image, using classic basketball reporting and dozens of new interviews to reveal the whole picture, from Bryant's childhood through his playing years. Showboat is filled with large personalities and provocative stories, including details of Bryant's complicated personal life and explosive relationships on the court, and is a riveting and essential read for every hoops fan.",

It's like a nasty virus you catch from a door handle at a public toilet.No team in sports is as uniquely hated as those smug, entitled, floor-slapping, fist-pumping, insufferable Blue Devils. The loathing has almost reached the level of a religion. Christian Laettner is a punk. Amen. The Cameron Crazies are obnoxious. The Plumlees are worthless times three. Coach K is a jerk. Kumbaya. The team is dogged by an intense hatred that no other team can match\u2015and for good reason. Millions of hoops fans and March Madness aficionados around the world are not imagining things. Duke really is evil, and within the pages of Duke Sucks, Reed Tucker and Andy Bagwell show readers exactly why Duke deserves to be so detested. They bruise and batter the Blue Devils with fact after fact, story after story, statistic after statistic. They build an airtight case that could stand up in a court of law.

    "description": "The annual NCAA Basketball Tournament, which has become known as \u201cMarch Madness\u201d has emerged as a major sports event, matched only by the Super Bowl and the Olympics. In Madness, Mark Mehler and Charles Paikert tell the stories behind the ten most compelling and memorable championship games in tournament history, from North Carolina\u2019s triple-overtime victory over Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s Kansas Wildcats in 1957 to Duke\u2019s heart stopping victory over underdog Butler in 2010. As a bonus, five more games that just missed the cut are also examined. Madness goes beyond the games to tell the the backstories of these classics, each entirely unique unto itself. For example, Jim Valvano taking his impossible dream of a national title and making it come true for the 1983 North Carolina State Wolfpack; Rollie Massimino turning spaghetti and clam sauce into inspiration for his underachieving 1985 Villanova team; and Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, breaking down in tears while taking a Broadway curtain call in front of a wildly-applauding audience who two hours earlier didn't know who these two guys were decades after their head-to-head matchup in 1979.  Some of these stories also resonate far beyond the basketball court, including the 1966 triumph by the Texas Western Miners, which helped chisel away the college basketball color line and stamped their victory as \"Glory Road.\" Over sixty years of college basketball history is brought to life in this must-have for all basketball fans.",

A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.The New York Times bestseller, now with a new introduction! The Breaks of the Game focuses on one grim season (1979-80) in the life of the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers, a team that only three years before had been NBA champions.The tactile authenticity of Halberstam's knowledge of the basketball world is unrivaled. Yet he is writing here about far more than just basketball. This is a story about a place in our society where power, money, and talent collide and sometimes corrupt, a place where both national obsessions and naked greed are exposed. It's about the influence of big media, the fans and the hype they subsist on, the clash of ethics, the terrible physical demands of modern sports (from drugs to body size), the unreal salaries, the conflicts of race and class, and the consequences of sport converted into mass entertainment and athletes transformed into superstars--all presented in a way that puts the reader in the room and on the court, and The Breaks of the Game in a league of its own.",

    "product_name": "Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich",
    "description": "Pistol is more than the biography of a ballplayer. It's the stuff of classic novels: the story of a boy transformed by his father's dream\u2014and the cost of that dream. Even as Pete Maravich became Pistol Pete\u2014a basketball icon for baby boomers\u2014all the Maraviches paid a price. Now acclaimed author Mark Kriegel has brilliantly captured the saga of an American family: its rise, its apparent ruin, and, finally, its redemption.Almost four decades have passed since Maravich entered the national consciousness as basketball's boy wizard. No one had ever played the game like the kid with the floppy socks and shaggy hair. And all these years later, no one else ever has. The idea of Pistol Pete continues to resonate with young people today just as powerfully as it did with their fathers. In averaging 44.2 points a game at Louisiana State University, he established records that will never be broken. But even more enduring than the numbers was the sense of ecstasy and artistry with which he played. With the ball in his hands, Maravich had a singular power to inspire awe, inflict embarrassment, or even tell a joke. But he wasn't merely a mesmerizing showman. He was basketball's answer to Elvis, a white Southerner who sold Middle America on a black man's game. Like Elvis, he paid a terrible price, becoming a prisoner of his own fame. Set largely in the South, Kriegel's Pistol, a tale of obsession and basketball, fathers and sons, merges several archetypal characters. Maravich was a child prodigy, a prodigal son, his father's ransom in a Faustian bargain, and a Great White Hope. But he was also a creature of contradictions: always the outsider but a virtuoso in a team sport, an exuberant showman who wouldn't look you in the eye, a vegetarian boozer, an athlete who lived like a rock star, a suicidal genius saved by Jesus Christ. A renowned biographer\u2014People magazine called him \u201ca master\u201d\u2014Kriegel renders his subject with a style that is, by turns, heartbreaking, lyrical, and electric. The narrative begins in 1929, the year a missionary gave Pete's father a basketball. Press Maravich had been a neglected child trapped in a hellish industrial town, but the game enabled him to blossom. It also caused him to confuse basketball with salvation. The intensity of Press's obsession initiates a journey across three generations of Maraviches. Pistol Pete, a ballplayer unlike any other, was a product of his father's vanity and vision. But that dream continues to exact a price on Pete's own sons. Now in their twenties\u2014and fatherless for most of their lives\u2014they have waged their own struggles with the game and its ghosts. Pistol is an unforgettable biography. By telling one family's history, Kriegel has traced the history of the game and a large slice of the American narrative.",

In the early 1930s, during the worst drought and financial depression in American history, Sam Babb began to dream. Like so many others, this charismatic Midwestern basketball coach wanted a reason to have hope. Traveling from farm to farm near the tiny Oklahoma college where he coached, Babb recruited talented, hardworking young women and offered them a chance at a better life: a free college education in exchange for playing on his basketball team, the Cardinals. &nbsp; Despite their fears of leaving home and the sacrifices that their families would face, the women joined the team. And as Babb coached the Cardinals, something extraordinary happened. These remarkable athletes found a passion for the game and a heartfelt loyalty to one another and their coach--and they began to win. Combining exhilarating sports writing and exceptional storytelling, Dust Bowl Girls takes readers on the Cardinals\u2019 intense, improbable journey all the way to an epic showdown with the prevailing national champions, helmed by the legendary Babe Didrikson. Lydia Reeder captures a moment in history when female athletes faced intense scrutiny from influential figures in politics, education, and medicine who denounced women\u2019s sports as unhealthy and unladylike.

Dean Oliver highlights general strategies for teams when they\u2019re winning or losing and what aspects should be the focus in either situation. He describes and quantifies the jobs of team leaders and role players, then discusses the interactions between players and how to achieve the best fit. Oliver conceptualizes the meaning of teamwork and how to quantify the value of different types of players working together. He examines historically successful NBA teams and identifies what made them so successful: individual talent, a system of putting players together, or good coaching. Oliver then uses these statistical tools and case studies to evaluate the best players in history, such as Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Charles Barkley and how they contributed to their teams\u2019 success. He does the same for some of the NBA\u2019s \"oddball\" players-Manute Bol, Muggsy Bogues, and Dennis Rodman and for the WNBA\u2019s top players. Basketball on Paper is unique in its incorporation of business and analytical concepts within the context of basketball to measure the value of players in a cooperative setting.

It was founded in a bizarre but momentous \"Land Run\" in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team\u2019s 2012-13 season, when the Thunder\u2019s brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game.

    "description": "Unlike the stories of most visible Division I college athletes, Amanda Ottaway s story has more in common with those of the 80 percent of college athletes who are never seen on TV. The Rebounders follows the college career of an average NCAA Division I women s basketball player in the twenty-first century, beginning with the recruiting process when Ottaway is an eager, naive teenager and ending when she's a more contemplative twentysomething alumna. Ottaway's story, along with the journeys of her dynamic Wildcat teammates at Davidson College in North Carolina, covers in engaging detail the life of a mid-major athlete: recruitment, the preseason, body image and eating disorders, schoolwork, family relationships, practice, love life, team travel, game day, injuries, drug and alcohol use, coaching changes, and what comes after the very last game. In addition to the everyday issues of being a student athlete, The Rebounders also covers the objectification of female athletes, race, sexuality, and self-expression. Most college athletes, famous or not, play hard, get hurt, fail, and triumph together in a profound love of their sport and one another, and then their careers end and they figure out how to move on. From concussions and minor injuries to classrooms, parties, and relationships, Ottaway understands the experience of a Division I women s basketball player firsthand.The Rebounders&nbsp;is, at its core, a feminist coming-of-age story, an exploration of what it means to be a young woman who loves a sport and is on a course of self-discovery through that medium.",

    "description": "Author, Mark Montieth spent decades researching this book through extensive interviews and access to previously unseen internal documents regarding the formation and early seasons of the Indiana Pacers in 1967. He tells the dramatic story of the noble, city-wide effort to establish the franchise after a 14-year hiatus from professional basketball in Indianapolis, as well as the tumultuous and electrifying early seasons when the franchise that thrives today first took root.More than merely recounting the games, he delves into the unique personalities of some of the players and the social issues that influenced their careers. He also captures the carefree, raucous nature of professional basketball in a basketball-crazed state in the Sixties. This was an era when fights in games were common, a player could pack a gun in carry-on luggage for a road trip, newspapers unabashedly promoted the team to help assure its survival, games were played in arenas so cold the players could see their breath, a player could be told he was traded while taking a post-game shower and fans would run onto the court and attack a referee after a game.The Pacers would go on to win three championships in the American Basketball Association, and their popularity would play a critical role in revitalizing downtown Indianapolis by establishing the need for a new arena. This book sets the stage for that era by exploring the difficult birth of the franchise and the fateful events that enabled it. It is illustrated with numerous photos, many never seen by the public.",

    "description": "I was dead for thirty seconds.That's what the cop in Fall River told me. When the EMTs found me, there was a needle in my arm and a packet of heroin in the front seat.At basketball-crazy Durfee High School in Fall River, Massachusetts, junior guard Chris Herren carried his family's and the city's dreams on his skinny frame. His grandfather, father, and older brother had created their own sports legends in a declining city; he was the last, best hope for a career beyond the shuttered mills and factories. Herren was heavily recruited by major universities, chosen as a McDonald's All-American, featured in a Sports Illustrated cover story, and at just seventeen years old became the central figure in Fall River Dreams, an acclaimed book about the 1994 Durfee team's quest for the state championship.  Leaving Fall River for college, Herren starred on Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State Bulldogs team of talented misfits, which included future NBA players as well as future convicted felons. His gritty, tattooed, hip-hop persona drew the ire of rival fans and more national attention: Rolling Stone profiled him, 60 Minutes interviewed him, and the Denver Nuggets drafted him. When the Boston Celtics acquired his contract, he lived the dream of every Massachusetts kid\u2015but off the court Herren was secretly crumbling, as his alcohol and drug use escalated and his life spiraled out of control. Twenty years later, Chris Herren was married to his high-school sweetheart, the father of three young children, and a heroin junkie. His basketball career was over, consumed by addictions; he had no job, no skills, and was a sadly familiar figure to those in Fall River who remembered him as a boy, now prowling the streets he once ruled, looking for a fix. One day, for a time he cannot remember, he would die.  In his own words, Chris Herren tells how he nearly lost everything and everyone he loved, and how he found a way back to life. Powerful, honest, and dramatic, Basketball Junkie is a remarkable memoir, harrowing in its descent, and heartening in its return.",

    "description": "The legend. In his own words.   From the poverty-stricken streets of Sao Paulo to an international icon and one of the most celebrated footballers of all time, Pele's life story is as extraordinary as it is enrapturing. With his trademark wit and deference, the legend draws us into a wonderful story lit by insight and humour and encompassing everything you ever wanted to know about the great man himself.   From shining shoes for extra pennies at the Baru Athletic Club to triumph in several World Cups, the glory of being on top of the world -- and staying there -- is shared in what is undoubtedly one of the must-read autobiographies of the year. On top of his athletic achievements, Pele has also been a staunch campaigner for human rights and in particular the plight of street children in his home country, leading to an appointment as a UN Ambassador and an honorary knighthood from the British monarchy.   By turns addictive, moving and enlightening, this is the ultimate story of the rise of a star and an amazing testimony to how even the lowliest of society's people can reach the dizzying heights of worldwide adoration and success.",

    "product_name": "Basketball Analytics: Objective and Efficient Strategies for Understanding How Teams Win",
    "description": "Basketball Analytics is a must-read for any sports analytics enthusiast or student of the game of basketball. Authors Stephen Shea, Ph.D. (Professor of Mathematics) and Christopher Baker (Software Engineer) utilize their unique skill-set to introduce original metrics for analyzing player performance, team style and team construction in the NBA. While demonstrating an awareness of the industry\u2019s best ideas, the authors present original, objective and efficient strategies for understanding how teams win. New player performance statistics include Offensive Efficiency (OE), Efficient Offensive Production (EOP), Defensive Stops Gained (DSG), and Approximate Value (AV). OE reflects a player\u2019s ability to make the most fundamental offensive decisions. EOP adjusts a player\u2019s points and assists based on his efficiency. DSG gives a complete measure of a player\u2019s defensive contributions, without relying on individual player statistics like blocks and steals. AV is a measure of total player performance that rivals any publicly available statistic. Basketball Analytics introduces groundbreaking metrics on player involvement in the offense. Point, Rebound and Assist Balance aggregate player usage in these critical statistics. New studies on the NBA show whether teams should strive for balance or unbalance. An NBA draft pick value study determines the average value of each pick and the likelihood of landing a star or role player with each draft position. The results of this study are used to discuss topics including the biggest draft blunders and steals, the draft success of each NBA team, and the quality of each draft class dating back to 1977. This valuable understanding of the NBA Draft creates a foundation for discussing various approaches to team development and construction. Additionally, the authors discuss redefining the positions on the court, unpredictability in the game, data visualization, and applications of spatial tracking technology. There are many intensely debated questions surrounding the NBA today. Who are the most valuable players, and how do they compare to past greats? Which players have the greatest impact on their team\u2019s defense? Should Kobe Bryant be concerned with getting his teammates involved in the offense? How do offenses differ in the clutch, and which players thrive in these situations? How difficult is it for a team to rebuild through the draft? Basketball Analytics introduces new statistics and new concepts to explore these questions and more.",

But there was a price. Pete brought a childlike exuberance to the court that often masked a tortured and confused adult. Things changed dramatically and permanently, however, when Pete found Christ.

    "description": "A memoir by the NBA Hall of Fame player, active from 1977-1993 and widely regarded as one of the all-time great New York Knicks. NBA Hall of Famer Bernard King is one of the most dynamic scorers in basketball history. King was notoriously private as a player, and rarely spoke to the press-not about his career and never about his personal life. And even beyond his prolific scoring, King will forever be remembered for the gruesome knee injury he suffered in 1985. Doctors who told him he'd never play again were shocked when he not only became the first player to return to the NBA from a torn ACL, but returned at an All Star level. In Game Face, King finally opens up about his life on and off the court. In his book, King's basketball I.Q. is on full display as he breaks down defenses using his own unique system for taking shots from predetermined spots on the floor. King talks about matching up against some of the all-time NBA greats, from Michael Jordan, Julius Erving and Charles Barkley to Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing and many others. He also tackles issues of race and family off the court, as well as breaking a personal cycle of negativity and self-destructiveness with the help of his family. Engaging, shocking, revelatory, yet always positive and upbeat, Bernard King's memoir appeals to multiple generations of basketball fans.",

He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrifice\u2014and pioneering surgery\u2014he recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir. Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Wooden\u2019s death at age ninety-nine. Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended. He eventually won an Emmy Award and other accolades for broadcasting and was recognized as a leading media pundit. John Wooden once said that no greatness ever came without sacrifice. Nothing better illustrates this saying than the real story of Walton\u2019s life. In his own words, Back from the Dead shares this dramatic story, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, his many setbacks and rebounds, and his ultimate triumph as the toughest of champions.",

    "product_name": "Alley-Oop to Aliyah: African American Hoopsters in the Holy Land",
    "description": "Every season, dozens of African American basketball players pack up their sneakers to play and live in Israel. They eat Israeli food, navigate Israeli hustle and bustle, experience cultural and religious customs in the world\u2019s only Jewish country, and voluntarily expose themselves to the omnipresent threat of violence in the volatile Middle East. Some players are both Black and Jewish by birth. Others choose to convert to Judaism while residing in Israel. Some go so far as to obtain Israeli citizenship, enlist in the Israeli Army, marry Israeli women, and stay long after their playing careers end. Alley-Oop to Aliyah: African American Hoopsters in the Holy Land, is the first book to provide an in-depth exploration and analysis of the experiences of African American basketball players in Israel from the 1970s till today. Author David A. Goldstein examines how they end up in the country in the first place, the multitude of distinctive aspects of their lives there, the challenges and difficulties they face, and the reasons some choose to return to Israel year after year. In some cases they even decide to stay in Israel permanently. Alley-Oop to Aliyah not only deals with basketball and its impact on Israel, but it delves into emotion-laden issues of race, religion, identity, and politics, primarily through the eyes of the players themselves, based on more than forty extensive first-person interviews Goldstein, a sports journalist of half-Israeli descent, conducted. Their stories and their impact on Israel are at the very heart of this revealing book that is about more than just a game.",

The NCAA championship game played that day launched an epic rivalry between two exceptional players: Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Larry Bird. Though they played each other only once as college athletes, that game transformed the NCAA tournament into a multibillion-dollar enterprise and laid the foundation for the resurgence of the NBA.

Davis also tells the stories of their remarkable coaches, Jud Heathcote and Bill Hodges, and he shows how tensions over race and class heightened the drama of the competition.Davis combed through several years' worth of newspaper and magazine coverage, interviewed nearly one hundred people, and watched dozens of games to reconstruct the colorful, historic, and improbable narrative of how Larry Bird and Magic Johnson burst on the scene\u2015a coming-of-age story that continues to resonate.

Yes, Charlie Ward's athletic accomplishments truly know no peer. Combine a twelve-year NBA career with a College Football Hall of Fame career and the portrait of a humble, magnanimous leader takes shape.The Athlete is the first definitive biography of Charlie Ward. Culled from hundreds of articles, clippings, books and original interviews with those who know Charlie best, this story begins with a foundation of college athletic excellence laid down by his father. From there, Jon Finkel traces Ward's background from small-town Thomasville, Georgia to football-crazed Tallahassee to basketball Mecca Madison Square Garden in New York City. Ward's remarkable journey includes staggering setbacks--from a near career-ending leg injury in high school, to academic obstacles prior to attending Florida State, to not being drafted by an NFL team after winning the Heisman Trophy. Through it all, Charlie's calm demeanor, high character and unshakeable faith buoyed his belief that be it basketball or football, grades or career, he was going to succeed and set a strong example along the way.As electrifying as Charlie Ward's highlight reel, The Athlete is a towering sports biography, epic in scope and triumphant in its portrayal of one of the greatest modern athletes the world has ever seen.",

    "product_name": "Coaching the System: A complete guide to basketball's most explosive style of play",
    "description": "\"If you are interested in Coaching the System, you must be either desperate or crazy!\" At least that's what people told authors Gary Smith and Doug Porter when they began investigating this revolutionary style of play almost a decade ago. Ignoring the critics, they went on to coach the two highest scoring teams in men's and women's college basketball history: the University of Redlands, California (132.4 ppg), and Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois (104.1 ppg). From its origins as the Sonny Allen Numbered Fast Break, to Paul Westhead\u2019s Loyola Marymount up-tempo game, the System has been around for decades. But when Grinnell College\u2019s David Arseneault added platoon substitution patterns and hockey-style short shifts, placing a priority on creating three-point looks for his \u201cpreferred shooters,\u201d the System truly came into its own. Smith and Porter learned the Grinnell version of the System from Arseneault himself, adapting it to fit their situations coaching men\u2019s and women\u2019s programs. In the past decade their teams set 32 NCAA and NAIA records between them, including most 100-point games in a season (Redlands-23; Olivet-24). Olivet also holds national records for defensive turnovers (36.3 per game) assists (23.8 per game), and three pointers made in a season (509, 15.6 per game). Redlands owns college basketball records (all levels) for field goal attempts (110.3 per game), and three-pointers made (23.8 per game). Now you can learn every detail of this devastating full court run-and-press attack that allows you to dictate tempo and force your opponents out of their normal game plan, capturing the imagination of your players and community, and making coaching fun again! You\u2019ll learn exactly how and why the System works, how to adapt it to fit your personnel, suggestions for conditioning players, organizing System practices, and even ways to respond to the inevitable criticisms that come with playing the game this far \u201coutside the box.\u201d Other chapters offer complete descriptions of the Redlands Attack (Coach Smith\u2019s variation of the Grinnell offense), the LMU Attack (which Westhead popularized and used to advance to the NCAA regional finals in 1990), and the Olivet Attack (Coach Porter\u2019s hybrid version of the LMU and Dribble-Drive offenses). Finally, you'll learn System defensive principles, terminology, and how to cover every conceivable press attack and press-breaker alignment. Also included are 57 drills and over 300 diagrams to illustrate System offense and defense, providing you with a complete blueprint for \u201cCoaching the System!\u201d",

A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of James Naismith, the game's inventor, McLendon taught his team to play the full-court press and run a fast break that no one could catch. His Eagles would become the highest-scoring college team in America--a basketball juggernaut that shattered its opponents by as many as sixty points per game. Yet his players faced danger whenever they traveled backcountry roads.Across town, at Duke University, the best basketball squad on campus wasn't the Blue Devils, but an all-white military team from the Duke medical school. Composed of former college stars from across the country, the team dismantled everyone they faced, including the Duke varsity. They were prepared to take on anyone--until an audacious invitation arrived, one that was years ahead of anything the South had ever seen before. What happened next wasn't on anyone's schedule. Based on years of research, The Secret Game is a story of courage and determination, and of an incredible, long-buried moment in the nation's sporting past. The riveting, true account of a remarkable season, it is the story of how a group of forgotten college basketball players, aided by a pair of refugees from Nazi Germany and a group of daring student activists, not only blazed a trail for a new kind of America, but helped create one of the most meaningful moments in basketball history.",

But that was with college kids.....Now, Coach K has stepped up to take on an entirely new challenge - by volunteering to coach the US Olympic Basketball team. Comprised of some of the biggest NBA stars, Coach K had to work with huge egos and personal rivalries in order to create an American team that could win against the best competition in the world and restore Team USA to the gold standard of basketball.This is more than a celebratory book - it's Coach K's first-hand account of how he dealt with such stars as Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony and all the rest to buy into his \"total team\" play. Half a book on basketball, half a book on management techniques, THE GOLD STANDARD captures Coach K's personal style and approach to getting different (and sometimes difficult) people to work hard and succeed in reaching a common goal.",

Back in the 1930s, a basketball sneaker was created for straight-up performance.

SLAM Kicks breaks down the path of the basketball sneaker, from the birth of the very first iconic shoe, the Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star, to the white-hot best-selling cultural-phenomenon Nike Air Jordan sneaker line. This book showcases the hottest basketball kicks over time, throwbacks and new shoes alike, covering each legendary sneaker and its design, the technical advancements found in the shoe, the athletes who made the shoe famous, and the cultural waves the footwear has made off the basketball court. Featured sneakers also include the Adidas Jabbar, the Puma Clyde, the Nike Air Force One, the Reebok Question, the AND1 Tai Chi, the Nike Zoom Kobe IV, and many others.

What was needed was an indoor wintertime game that combined recreation and competition. One evening he worked out the fundamentals of a game that would quickly catch on. Two peach half-bushel baskets gave the name to the brand new sport in late 1891.&nbsp;Basketball: Its Origin and Development was written by the inventor himself, who was inspired purely by the joy of play. Naismith, born in northern Ontario in 1861, gave up the ministry to preach clean living through sport. He describes Duck on the Rock, a game from his Canadian childhood, the creative reasoning behind his basket game, the eventual refinement of rules and development of equipment, the spread of amateur and professional teams throughout the world, and the growth of women\u2019s basketball (at first banned to male spectators because the players wore bloomers). Naismith lived long enough to see basketball included in the Olympics in 1936. Three years later he died, after nearly forty years as head of the physical education department at the University of Kansas.",

Coach Knight, the second-winningest coach in NCAA history with 902 victories, explains that victory is often attained by the team that makes the fewest mistakes. His coaching philosophy was to instill discipline by \"preparing to win\" rather than hoping to win. That meant understanding the downside and drilling his teams to prevent the things that could go wrong. And when his teams did win, he made sure they didn\u2019t dwell on their success, but rather looked immediately to the challenges of the next game. He applies this lesson to business strategy as well.",

While no coach treasures a win more than John, this terrific book reveals his greater purpose\u2014to lead his young players to better lives, and then challenge them to give back to others.\" \u2014President William J. Clinton&nbsp;In Players First, John Calipari relates for the first time anywhere his experiences over his first four years coaching the Kentucky Wildcats, college basketball\u2019s most fabled program, from the doldrums to a national championship, drawing lessons about leadership, character, and the path to personal and collective victory.At its core, Calipari\u2019s coaching philosophy centers on keeping his focus on the players\u2014what they need to get the best out of themselves and one another. He is beloved by his players for being utterly honest with them and making promises that he always keeps, no matter what. He knows that in this age, they come to Kentucky to prepare for the NBA; every year he gets players who in a previous era would have gone directly into the pros from high school but now have to play college basketball for one year. Calipari has fought against this system, but he has to play within it, and so he does, better than anyone.The result is an extraordinary leadership challenge: every year Coach Cal gets a handful of eighteen-year-old kids who have been in a bubble for the previous four years at least, filled with hype about their own greatness, and they come to Kentucky feeling sure that they will play for their coach only for seven months before they go on to greater glory. Every year, he has to reinvent his team. After his 2012 NCAA championship, it was particularly dramatic; he lost his first six players in the first round, meaning that someone who couldn\u2019t even start for Kentucky was a first-round draft pick.The overall record at Kentucky, and for his career, puts Calipari in the pantheon of the greatest coaches in the history of the game. Bold, funny, and truthful, like Coach Calipari himself, Players First is truly the first deep reckoning with the meaning of his experiences and the gifts of insight they offer.",

    "product_name": "Glory Hounds: How a Small Northwest School Reshaped College Basketball. And Itself.",
    "description": "Almost a generation ago, a small school from the Northwest made its first noise in college basketball. For the first time, the Gonzaga Bulldogs won games in the NCAA tournament of 1999, going all the way to the Elite Eight. Then they validated their arrival with Sweet 16 appearances the next two years. Unlike other unheralded programs that have emerged to make national headlines, the Zags didn\u2019t go away. They have stacked solid season upon solid season and as they enter 2016-17, they boast an 18-year streak of playing in the NCAA tournament -- a run of success that includes eight straight years of March Madness victories. A few years after the men\u2019s program took off, the Gonzaga women also reached unprecedented heights -- partly with the help of a fan base that couldn\u2019t get tickets to the men\u2019s games, but pushed the women to a top-15 national ranking in attendance. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the story of how it all came together at Gonzaga for both men and women, how it changed the school, and how -- in a turbulent time of here-and-gone players in college basketball -- it continues. The Gonzaga story is woven deeply into the longevity of head coach Mark Few and his choice to stay at the school in the face of multiple offers to move elsewhere. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d takes a close look at Few, his small-town roots and his decision to stay put. The book explores the rise of Few\u2019s longtime assistant, Tommy Lloyd, and his recruiting acumen overseas that has made Gonzaga one of the most popular destinations for foreign players. It documents the almost zany events that led to the construction of a new arena on campus in 2004; the unforgettable season of Adam Morrison in 2006; and the heartbreak and redemption of Josh Heytvelt. It chronicles the redshirt-year growth that has aided the program, and it details the paradox that keeps Seattle from becoming a productive recruiting pool for the Zags. Gonzaga\u2019s women authored their own rise to prominence, and \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d recounts that ascent, as well as the wizardry of the best women\u2019s player in school history, Courtney Vandersloot. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the first attempt to bind together the various elements that, in a span now stretching into a generation, have made the Gonzaga story so compelling.",

    "product_name": "Glory Hounds: How a Small Northwest School Reshaped College Basketball. And Itself.",
    "description": "Almost a generation ago, a small school from the Northwest made its first noise in college basketball. For the first time, the Gonzaga Bulldogs won games in the NCAA tournament of 1999, going all the way to the Elite Eight. Then they validated their arrival with Sweet 16 appearances the next two years. Unlike other unheralded programs that have emerged to make national headlines, the Zags didn\u2019t go away. They have stacked solid season upon solid season and as they enter 2016-17, they boast an 18-year streak of playing in the NCAA tournament -- a run of success that includes eight straight years of March Madness victories. A few years after the men\u2019s program took off, the Gonzaga women also reached unprecedented heights -- partly with the help of a fan base that couldn\u2019t get tickets to the men\u2019s games, but pushed the women to a top-15 national ranking in attendance. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the story of how it all came together at Gonzaga for both men and women, how it changed the school, and how -- in a turbulent time of here-and-gone players in college basketball -- it continues. The Gonzaga story is woven deeply into the longevity of head coach Mark Few and his choice to stay at the school in the face of multiple offers to move elsewhere. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d takes a close look at Few, his small-town roots and his decision to stay put. The book explores the rise of Few\u2019s longtime assistant, Tommy Lloyd, and his recruiting acumen overseas that has made Gonzaga one of the most popular destinations for foreign players. It documents the almost zany events that led to the construction of a new arena on campus in 2004; the unforgettable season of Adam Morrison in 2006; and the heartbreak and redemption of Josh Heytvelt. It chronicles the redshirt-year growth that has aided the program, and it details the paradox that keeps Seattle from becoming a productive recruiting pool for the Zags. Gonzaga\u2019s women authored their own rise to prominence, and \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d recounts that ascent, as well as the wizardry of the best women\u2019s player in school history, Courtney Vandersloot. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the first attempt to bind together the various elements that, in a span now stretching into a generation, have made the Gonzaga story so compelling.",

    "description": "For twelve years the women\u2019s basketball rivalry between UConn and Tennessee was the most iconic matchup in women\u2019s sports. Even now, twenty years since the annual series started, the competition between these two storied programs still provokes heated argument and bitter resentment. Led by Hall of Fame coaches Geno Auriemma and Pat Summitt, UConn and Tennessee combined for nine national championships, with the UConn Huskies winning five\u2014including four against the Tennessee Lady Vols. In all, UConn won thirteen of twenty-two matchups during the rivalry, and along the way the two coaches\u2014with distinctive and brash personalities and a shared determination to rule their sport\u2014clashed privately and publicly, generating enough heat to make women\u2019s basketball relevant in the national sports landscape as never before.On the court, the two teams produced a series of memorable games, from overtime thrillers to timeless classics that defined the sport. Off the court, the coaches\u2019 encounters were often marked by their seemingly genuine dislike for each other, until the conflict reached a breaking point in 2007 and Summitt stunned the basketball world by canceling the series for reasons neither side has ever revealed.Now, eight years after the last game, Unrivaled uncovers the on-court and behind-the-scenes story of this intensely personal rivalry between coaches, players, and the two most passionate fan bases women\u2019s sports has ever known.&nbsp;",

This holiday season, if you buy the print edition as a gift, you can keep the Kindle edition for yourself! In Gregg Popovich: The Inspiring Life and Leadership Lessons of One of Basketball's Greatest Coaches, you will learn the inspirational story of one of basketball's premier coaches, Gregg Popovich. Popovich has steered the ship for the San Antonio Spurs franchise to multiple championships and perennial playoff contention. Despite having to navigate several key personnel changes over the years, Pop has demonstrated a truly unique ability to adapt to the direction of the game. When he retires from coaching, Pop will go down as one of the greatest coaches of all time. There are a number of key leadership lessons that can be learned from Pop, such as getting the right players on your team, maximizing the potential of each individual player, and remaining a stern disciplinarian to earn the trust and respect of your team. Here is a preview of what is inside this book:  Background Story NBA Coaching Career Building the Spurs Dynasty The Gregg Popovich System How Gregg Popovich Maximizes Player Talent Gregg Popovich, the Leader Key Takeaways Conclusion and Gregg Popovich's Legacy  An excerpt from the book: Much like how soldiers are the reasons why countries win battles, players are the reasons why NBA teams win games on the hardwood floor. The countless hours they put into honing and crafting their game in the gym and weight room contributes to how they affect the outcome of games. They sacrifice and pour out their sweat, tears, and even blood for the purpose of giving wins to their teams and fans.   But while NBA games are won by the players on the floor, preparation and strategy have always been the keys to winning championships. Soldiers may be the reasons why battles are won, but wars are won outside of the battlefield. And in the NBA, players may be the reasons why teams win games, but championships are won by the leadership of their coaches. And when it comes down to coaching, one would be hard-pressed to find someone better than Gregg Popovich in that department.   There have been many great coaches that have become legendary names in the history of the NBA. There was Red Auerbach, who was a revolutionary at making his team focus on making each other better on his way to nine NBA championships during the 60's era of the league. While relying on Bill Russell's leadership on the floor, the Boston Celtics were winning titles and dominating in a less competitive era because of how Auerbach instilled in them the basics and fundamentals of team play.  Decades later, Pat Riley would make the Los Angeles Lakers the best show on the planet by running a fast-paced system that relied on the fastbreak and passing skills of Magic Johnson. Riley would win four titles with the Lakers back in the 80's and would later win one again with the Miami Heat in 2006 at the tail end of his coaching career.

    "description": "21st Century Guide to Individual Skill Development is the player's version of The 21st Century Basketball Practice, but can be used by coaches or skill trainers as a complement to The 21st Century Basketball Practice. The philosophy and concepts between the two books are the same, but this book focuses on individual skill development, specifically shooting, finishing, and dribbling. The book contains a chapter about the specific skills, but the book is centered on strategies to improve your individual practice. McCormick outlines and explains various strategies that worked for him as a player, coach, and skill trainer, and that are supported, in most cases, by research. In addition to his personal examples and research, McCormick includes examples from modern-day superstars such as Stephen Curry and his visit to an NBA team's offseason workouts. This book is about individual practice and skill development, but individual skill is a misnomer. Games are complex. There is no isolated or individual skill: All skills are interdependent. Despite the interdependence of skills, players do and should practice individually. This book provides strategies to enhance the effectiveness of individual practice, and offers advice on skill development hacks off the court, the usefulness of private coaches, and the value of play, pickup games, and collective skill development. McCormick's philosophy centers on a few important concepts: Technique and skill are different; complex and hard describe different things; training and learning are not synonymous; intrinsic motivation is vital; and constant feedback interrupts learning. The specific strategies fit within this philosophy and describe different approaches for skill development, whether by oneself, with a private coach, or with a training group. The objective is to give players the tools and ideas to improve their individual practice and offseason training to maximize their skill development.",

After playing his college ball at Penn State, Tyler Smith had a path in mind of where he wanted his pro basketball career to lead. Bringing his own toilet paper to away games, courts made of concrete, and fully-geared riot police at every stadium were not part of his original dream.  Where were all the big contracts people talked about? Would he even have a job next season\u2015or next week? And would he be playing for free this month because the team didn\u2019t feel like paying him? In this highly unstable and unorthodox overseas lifestyle as a professional basketball player, Smith draws readers in quickly with his humor and ability to share his clever stories that seem outrageous, but are 100 percent true. His attitude and faith are tested relentlessly through bounced paychecks, injuries, and the seemingly endless frustrating reality of people around him speaking a language he could not understand. From Italy to Japan to Uruguay, and even the NBA, the challenges and adventures only accelerate as Tyler\u2019s wife and kids are added to the overseas equation. His unique story is highly engaging whether or not you\u2019re a basketball junkie.

In it he shares his most treasured memories and never-before-seen photographs as he looks back on an extraordinary life on and off the court. Hailed by many as the greatest coach in the history of American sports, John Wooden is as famous for his personal philosophy as he is for his career achievements. He inspired, guided, and motivated generations of fans with his bestselling books on leadership, values, family, and the true meaning of success.

Here was the seemingly unbeatable Duke Blue Devils pitted against the first-time finalist Connecticut Huskies, and at stake was the ultimate crown: the National Championship. On that unforgettable night in St. Petersburg, Jim Calhoun and his amazing team wrote a new chapter in the storied history of the UConn Huskies program, putting the perfect exclamation point on a season to remember.But behind the high drama that fateful night in Florida lay an even more fascinating tale of one man's rise to college basketball preeminence. In Dare to Dream, the Huskies iron-willed coach, Jim Calhoun, for the first time shares his own story about his inspirational family and the tragedies they faced; about his early successful years at Northeastern, where he began to compile the first half of a unique double (he's the only coach to have won at least 250 games at two different Division I schools); and about his assumption of ultimate responsibility at the sleeping giant in Storrs, Connecticut.Along the way, Jim Calhoun paints fascinating portraits of the players who have done battle for him, and of the unsung heroes behind the scenes whose hard work and dedication to Connecticut basketball have kept the dream alive. In just thirteen years, Jim Calhoun has turned the Huskies into one of the leading basketball programs in the country, and in this moving, funny, and inspiring book, he takes us behind the scenes to show us just how he did it.From the Hardcover edition.",

In Brad Stevens: The Inspiring Life and Leadership Lessons of One of Basketball's Greatest Young Coaches, you will learn the story of one of basketball's young star coaches, Brad Stevens. Since joining the Celtics organization in the summer of 2013, Brad Stevens has led the resurgence of the Celtics in the Eastern Conference. Stevens has demonstrated impressive leadership in his ability to quickly build rapport with many different personalities and to create a sustainable system of success. While he is still early in his coaching career, Brad Stevens has quickly become one of the most sought after coaches in the NBA. There are a number of key leadership lessons that can be learned from Stevens, such as instilling a strong work ethic, believing in your organizational philosophy, and fostering a growth mindset. Whether you're a basketball player or a coach looking for inspiration, this book will help you discover the incredible story of Brad Stevens and the many leadership lessons that can be learned from studying his success. Here is a preview of what is inside this book:  Background and History Coaching at Butler What Makes Brad Stevens a Good Leader How Brad Stevens Maximizes Player Talent Brad Stevens' System Key Takeaways in Work Ethic, Believing in the Organizational Philosophy, and the Growth Mindset Conclusion  An excerpt from the book: They say that being a coach is about having the experience of being able to play and experience what it is like to be on an NBA court where basketball is played at its highest level. It is always different when you have experienced the hard grind and difficulty of going through an NBA season, and then you try to preach it to players that are also trying to carve out their NBA careers.  Some of the more successful players turned NBA coaches include the 11-time NBA champion coach Phil Jackson, who was part of the 1972-73 championship roster of the New York Knicks. He would soon become an assistant for the Chicago Bulls in the 80's before he took the reins as the head coach and won six titles for them in the 90's. He then would win five more titles for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2000's era.  Many other former NBA players that have found themselves coaching teams in the big league. These include Bill Russell (who once played for the Celtics, but ended up coaching them after), Larry Bird (who played for Boston but coached the Pacers later on), and Doc Rivers (who was a key part of the Hawks in the 80's and won a title with the Celtics as a coach). Byron Scott was a key member of the Showtime Lakers, who would coach the New Orleans Hornets and the Lakers soon afterward, among others.   It is those coaches' experience as NBA players that have provided the knowledge and know-how they needed to become successful in their endeavors as strategists in the league. Their personnel can relate to what they have experienced as former players, and that is an aspect of coaching that has been difficult to replace. They know what it takes to manage a grinding NBA season and probably even a title run.

Basketball serves as the way of unpacking the greater story, a behind the scenes journey that provides a privileged glimpse into the hearts of 15 young men, three coaches, two managers, trainer, and a cast of colorful small-town characters as the teams strive to win the CCAA and Division II National Championship. Through the Red Door is the first book ever written about the world of Division II college basketball. The book reveals the story of how Coach Clink turned an underfunded program that had been struggling on both the court and in the classroom into an elite Division II program that that has reached the NCAA Championship Tournament Elite Eight twice in the last four years and made the NCAA Championship Tournament six seasons straight. More importantly, Coach Clink\u2019s players have a graduation rate that is well above 80% while the overall graduation rate for Division II college basketball players is 46% for student-athletes who entered the university as freshman. As the banged-up red door on the cover of the book metaphorically portrays, the young men in this book both literally and figuratively move through the door and go beyond. The reader learns how Coach Clink built his program by establishing a culture where redshirting is the norm, a culture that amplifies the value of work, cohesion, family, and integrity. Coach Clink instills the timeless fundamentals of life that translate to any aspect of life \u2014 whether it is a classroom or corporate conference room \u2014 assisting his players to sharpen leadership traits.",

    "description": "The DREAM TEAM was a bunch of kids from Akron, Ohio-LeBron James and his best friends-who first met on a youth basketball team of the same name when they were ten and eleven years old. United by their love of the game and their yearning for companionship, they quickly forged a bond which would carry them through thick and thin (a lot of thin) and, at last, to the brink of a national championship. They were a motley group who faced challenges all too typical of inner-city America. LeBron grew up without a father and had moved with his mother more than a dozen times by the age of 10. Willie McGee, the quiet one, had left both his parents behind in Chicago to be raised by his older brother in Akron. Dru Joyce was outspoken, and his dad, who was ever-present, would end up coaching all five of the boys in high school. Sian Cotton, who also played football, was the happy-go-lucky enforcer, while Romeo Travis was unhappy, bitter, even surly, until he finally opened himself up to the bond his team mates offered. In the summer after seventh grade, the DREAM TEAM tasted glory when they qualified for a national championship tournament in Memphis. But they lost their focus, and had to go home early. They promised each other they would stay together and do whatever it took to win a national title. They had no idea how hard it would be to pursue that promise. In the years that followed, they would endure jealousy, hostility, exploitation, resentment from the black community (because they went to a \"white\" high school), and the consequence of their own over-confidence. Not least, they would all have to wrestle with LeBron's outsize success, which brought too much attention and even a whiff of scandal their way. But together these five boys became men as they sought a national championship.",

With a warrior's heart and an artist's grace, Jordan long ago transcended the sport to become one of the 20th century's global icons.On the court, his almost mythic flair for the spectacular prompted former Los Angeles Laker superstar Magic Johnson to say simply, \"There's Michael, then there's all the rest of us.\"Off the court, Jordan's ability to alter markets and drive the business of his marketing partners is unprecedented.Through it all, Jordan showed the world that greatness, true greatness, comes from the inside out. He remains perhaps the greatest practice player in the history of sports, his desire to improve upon his own example legendary. When critics questioned his all-around ability, he became the game's most dominant defensive player at his position. When teams decided to close down the lane and eliminate drives to the basket, he became a deadly jump shooter. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson had the most successfully teams of the 1980s but never won more than two consecutive championships. The Bulls won three straight--twice.In For the Love of the Game, Jordan takes us through the wonder of his career on the court and away from the game. From the dream that preceded the game-winning shot against Georgetown in the 1982 NCAA Finals to the methodical dissection of the Utah Jazz prior to his game-winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, Jordan pulls back the curtain on one of the most remarkable lives this century.",

Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s--Celtics vs Lakers, East vs West, physical vs finesse, Old School vs Showtime, even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness--together Bird and Johnson collected 8 NBA Championships, and 6 MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals, but along the way they became lifelong friends.With intimate, fly-on-the-wall detail, When the Game Was Ours transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness, we come to understand Larry's obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young, invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat, not just as a player but as a team leader. We are there the moment he learns he's contracted HIV and hear in his own words how that devastating news impacted his relationships in basketball and beyond. But always, in both cases, we see them prevail.A compelling, up-close-and-personal portrait of basketball's most inimitable duo, When the Game Was Ours is a reevaluation of three decades in counterpoint.

This defense rotates, or flexes, to take on a different shape every time the ball moves or players positions change.

Yet, coaching kids to be ultra-competitive guarantees no greater probability of players becoming successful, well-adjusted members of society when their playing days have ended. Building Good Teammates is the story of how a \u201cMary Poppins-ish\u201d nun inspires Lance Loya to discover an alternative approach to coaching and to explore how his coaching methods were influenced by his unusual childhood and his personal Mount Rushmore\u2014the four men who had the biggest impact on his life. Loya grew up in the iconic Ship Hotel and his adventures in the historic building and the aftermath of the business\u2019s failure caused him to become very calloused and scoped his early coaching style. Through the examination of the virtue of trust, a key component to being a good teammate, he explains how the coaches who impacted his life demonstrated how to have, build, and earn trust. Those three elements coincide with Loya\u2019s three components of a good teammate\u2014care, share, and listen. While teaching kids to be competitive can be beneficial, it is an endeavor that should take a back seat to teaching kids to be good teammates, a more valuable life skill. Everybody is part of a team in some capacity, and the world cannot have too many good teammates. When Sr. Eric Marie, a nearly 80-year old nun, joins Loya\u2019s quest to build good teammates, the practices of the unassuming woman become the basis for the coach\u2019s system. Loya explains how the Sisters of Mercy values of mercy, justice, hospitality, and service can be applied to using sports to teach kids to be good teammates. This book is not an advertisement for organized religion. It is a blueprint for using organized sports to teach kids a viable and sustainable skill that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.",

They were there for North Carolina's triple overtime takedown of Wilt Chamberlain and Kansas in 1957, for Texas Western's historic upset of Kentucky in 1966 and for Villanova's brilliant upending of Georgetown in 1985. Having chronicled all the madness from the fall (Midnight) through the spring (March) year after year, SI's award-winning photographers have captured the indelible images of buzzer-beating shots, of court-storming celebrations and of some of the world's largest men bawling over heartbreaking defeats. Those memorable stories and pictures are presented here as never before in this magnificent, must-have book for any college hoops fan.",

    "description": "In basketball, as in most sports, a large part of a coach\u2019s responsibility is to prepare his or her team for games. Yet, little time in practice is typically devoted to readying the players and coaches for specific game situations. For instance, what are the various ways to use dead ball moments to maximum advantage? What adjustments should be made to launch a comeback in particular circumstances? When is it favorable to purposefully miss a foul shot? In Odds-On Basketball Coaching: Crafting High-Percentage Strategies for Game Situations, Michael J. Coffino presents an innovative system for coaches to prepare for specific game scenarios. Coffino challenges coaches to think differently about what they emphasize in practice, placing greater value on preparing for recurring game situations, crafting strategies by assessing the odds, and creating a culture that elevates how players think about the game. Each chapter begins with an actual game scenario that illustrates the chapter\u2019s content and includes discussions of notable college and professional basketball games in order to demonstrate specific points. Odds-On Basketball Coaching provides a framework for making game decisions beyond instincts and habits. It is intended, more than anything, to stimulate coaches and players to think comprehensively and realistically about how to approach games and practices, fostering an environment where everyone can more incisively make game-time decisions. While high school and youth basketball coaches will find this book most helpful, coaches at all levels will benefit from this novel approach to the game.",

Michael Jordan once said that we all want to say the things that Barkley says, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare. But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inside the NBA and CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TalkBack Live, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book\u00e2\u0080\u0094and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here\u00e2\u0080\u0094not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarly on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Washington Post columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him. And that makes him as radically different in these modern celebrity times as a 6-foot-4-inch power forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing Charles Barkley knows, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the crying need for honest, open discussion in this country\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more uncomfortable the subject, the more necessary the dialogue. And if the discussion leader can be as wise, irreverent, (occasionally) profane and (consistently) funny as Charles Barkley, so much the better. Many people are going to be shocked and scandalized by I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It, but many more will stand up and cheer. Like Molly Ivins or Bill O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly, Charles Barkley is utterly his own thinker, and everything he says comes from deep reflection. One way or another, if more blood hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reached your brain by the time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished this book, maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been embalmed.",

    "description": "Part sports star, part antihero, part hip-hop icon, Allen Iverson has managed to cross over into the mainstream of American culture -- without compromise. Defiantly tattooed, with his hair in cornrows, the six-foot Philadelphia 76ers point guard is one of the most recognizable and controversial stars of the sports world. His meteoric rise from a troubled childhood in the ghetto to NBA superstardom has been marked by five straight playoff appearances, including a finals berth in 2001 and an MVP award. From his rap sheet to his rap album, fans and journalists alike hound his every move. But never before has a biographer presented a full portrait of this complicated and intensely private star -- a man whose loyalty to his family, the streets, and his friends trumps any other concern. Filled with exclusive interview material and unprecedented access to many of Iverson's inner circle, Only the Strong Survive is the first in-depth look at the truth behind this newly minted legend.",

Pat was just 64 at the time, having battled Alzheimer s disease for at least five years. Expressions of grief as well as memories and testimonials about Pat were immediate, passionate, and plentiful. It was on a level befitting a head of state. President Barack Obama, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, and two-time-Super Bowl-winning quarterback Peyton Manning, a UT alum and longtime Summitt friend, were among those publicly expressing their personalized sympathies.Summitt's career coaching numbers were off-the-chart stellar. They included an NCAA record (male or female) 1,098 career victories, eight national championships, and sixteen Southeastern Conference regular-season titles and sixteen SEC Tournament championships. What those numbers don't tell, though, are the countless friends and fans that Summitt met along the way, and the thousands of lives she touched in an inspirational manner that extended well beyond the basketball court.I Remember Pat Summitt is more verbal scrapbook than it is biography; it s an oral history of her life told by dozens who knew her well at different points in her life, to include many of her former players and coaching peers. In their own words, they talk openly and candidly about Pat, taking readers on the hall of famer s journey from her teenage Trish years in rural Cheatham County, Tennessee, to her days as a basketball All American at Tennessee-Martin, to her exploits as a player and as a coach on the international stage, to her nearly four decades coaching in Knoxville, helping to elevate women s basketball from an athletic-department afterthought to the pinnacle of the sports world. The book also goes inside her battle with Alzheimer's, in which she bravely and relentlessly put a public face on an insidious disease that ravages many.Included in the book is a foreword from basketball superstar Nancy Lady Magic Lieberman, who was a teammate of Pat s on the 1976 U.S. women s Olympic basketball team and a player under Pat when Summitt was an assistant coach for the 1980 U.S. women s Olympic team.",

    "description": "\"It wasn't a team.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tent revival.\"So says Pat Summitt, the legendary coach whose Tennessee Lady Vols entered the 1997-98 season aiming for an almost unprecedented \"three-peat\" of NCAA championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise the Roof takes you right inside the locker room of her amazing team, whose inspired mixture of gifted freshmen and seasoned stars produced a standard of play that would change the game of women's basketball forever.The 1997-98 season started innocently enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;One Saturday in August, four young freshmen--Semeka Randall, Tamika Catchings, Ace Clement and Teresa Geter--arrived on the Tennessee campus to begin their college careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcoming them were a number of players from the previous year, including Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that night, in a sign of things to come, a simple pickup game turned into an amazing display of basketball brilliance--freshmen against established players, and with barely a shot missed by either side.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly Pat Summitt glimpsed the future: fast, aggressive and hugely talented.&nbsp;&nbsp;This might be the team she'd worked her whole career to coach.As the season got under way, other dramas unfolded.&nbsp;&nbsp;After one emotional team meeting, Summitt realized that many on the team were playing for something more than just the glory of the game: all four freshmen, for example, came from single-parent homes, and the tough circumstances of the majority of the other players seemed to add an extra edge to their desire to win it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Chamique Holdsclaw, widely regarded as the greatest female player ever, was being dogged by questions about turning pro--and she seemed reluctant to rule it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, another member of the team began to notice the unwelcome attentions of a fan, who soon turned out to be a full-fledged stalker.All this was behind the scenes; out on the court, the win column was swelling with every game: 8-0, 15-0, 21-0.&nbsp;&nbsp;As 1997 turned into 1998, Pat Summitt began privately to admit that this team had changed her: these kids were so lovable, funny and eager to please that she simply had to let them into her heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the Lady Vols were redefining what women were capable of, trading in old definitions of femininity for new ones--in short, they were keeping score.&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the time they entered the NCAA Final Four tournament in Kansas City, Summitt found herself believing the impossible: despite all the distractions, the 1997-98 Lady Vols could go undefeated, and, in doing so, raise the roof off the sport of women's basketball.Packed with the excitement of a season on the brink of perfection and filled with the comedy and tragedy of one year in the life of a basketball team, Raise the Roof will have readers cheering from the bench for a team of all-conquering players and their astonishing coach.From the Hardcover edition.",

    "product_name": "Sugar: Micheal Ray Richardson, Eighties Excess, and the NBA",
    "description": "The 1980s were arguably the NBA\u2019s best decade, giving rise to Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan.&nbsp;They were among the game\u2019s greatest players who brought pro basketball out of its 1970s funk and made it faster, more fluid, and more exciting. Off the court the game was changing rapidly too, with the draft lottery, shoe commercials, and a style driven largely by excess. One player who personified the eighties excess is Micheal Ray Richardson. During his eight-year career in the NBA (1978\u201386), he was a four-time All-Star, twice named to the All-Defense team, and the first player to lead the league in both assists and steals. He was also a heavy cocaine user who went on days-long binges but continued to be signed by teams that hoped he\u2019d get straight.&nbsp;Eventually he was the first and only player to be permanently disqualified from the NBA for repeat drug use. Tracking the rise, fall, and eventual redemption of Richardson throughout his playing days and subsequent coaching career, Charley Rosen describes the life\u2011defining pitfalls Richardson and other players faced and considers key themes such as off\u2011court and on\u2011court racism, anti-Semitism, womanizing, allegations of point\u2011shaving within the league, and drug and alcohol abuse by star players. By constructing his various lines of narration around the polarizing figure of Richardson\u2014equal parts basketball savant, drug addict, and pariah\u2014Rosen illuminates some of the more unseemly aspects of the NBA during this period,&nbsp;going behind the scenes to provide an account of what the league\u2019s darker side was like during its celebrated golden age. &nbsp;&nbsp;",

    "description": "On November 15, 1993, a white-haired, 72-year-old gentleman named Dr. Amberry stepped up to the free throw line and into the Guinness Book of World Records by sinking 2,750 shots in a row. He ended his 12-hour streak without a miss, stopping only because they had to close the gym for the night.  In Free Throw, he reveals his secrets. Beginning with the proper mechanics of the shot, he then explains the importance of the mental game and shares his techniques to help players stay on target even while under pressure. Combining these mental and physical elements, he presents a unique and straightforward 7-step method that teaches readers how to become a 90% free throw shooter.  The free throw is the Achilles heel of the basketball player -- many players are great from the floor but lousy at the line. Free Throw is the only book to address this important skill. Clearly written, with principles that are easy to put into practice, it is an indispensable manual for all basketball players and coaches.",

Scattered throughout the pages are pep talks, records, and Jayhawks lore, including lyrics to \u201cI\u2019m a Jayhawk\u201d; stories from Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s years at Kansas; Phog Allen\u2019s 39 seasons on the Kansas bench; Roy Williams\u2019 memorable 15-year run, including three trips to the Final Four.

    "description": "Hope High School in Providence, Rhode Island was once a model city school, graduating a wide range of students from different backgrounds. But the tumult of the 1960s and the drug wars of the 70s changed both Providence and Hope. Today, the aging school is primarily Hispanic and African-American, with kids traveling for miles by bus and foot each day. Hope was known for its state championship basketball teams in the 1960s, but its 2012 team is much different. Disobedient, distracted, and overwhelmed by family troubles, with mismatched sneakers and a penchant for profanity and anger, these boys represent Coach Dave Nyblom's dream of a championship, however unlikely that might seem. Nyblom's mostly black players, including several who emigrated to Providence from war-torn Liberia, face gang violence, domestic uncertainty, drug problems, and a host of other issues. But with the unfailing support and guidance of Nyblom and other Hope coaches, their ragtag team gradually pulls together, overcoming every obstacle to find the faith and trust in themselves that Nyblom never stops teaching.A look at a hidden world that just a few hundred yards from Brown University, Bill Reynolds' Hope is the inspiring true story of young men and their mentors pursuing one goal\u2015a championship\u2015but achieving so much more.",

    "description": "Bob Knight was a head coach in college basketball at twenty-four, coach of an unbeaten NCAA champion at thirty-five, coach of the last amateur team to win the Olympic men's basketball gold medal at forty-three, and out of a job at not quite sixty.His shock, disappointment and anger over Indiana University's manner of firing a twenty-nine-year employee comes through clearly in his account of his last turbulent year there.And it is his account. Few people in sports have had more books written about them. This is the first by Bob Knight - one of the most literate, candid, quoted and outspoken men in American public life telling in this first-person account of his full, rich life.Much of that life has been in basketball, most of it because of basketball, but it also has brought him forward as a coach who has proved academic responsibility and production of championship college athletic teams not only can co-exist but should.His excitement as things start anew for him at Texas Tech is matched here by his characteristic frankness and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, as he tells story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull.Knight, as a sophomore front-line reserve on the Ohio State team that won the NCAA championship, became the first man to play on and coach a championship team when he led his 1975-76 Indiana team to a 32-0 season that was capped by an 86-68 victory over Michigan in the NCAA championship game at Philadelphia.His Indiana teams in 1980-81 and 1986-87 also won NCAA titles, making him one of just four coaches in history to win as many as three championships. Twenty-six years later, the 1975-76 Indiana team still stands as the last unbeaten team in major- college men's basketball. Knight's coaching career includes six seasons at Army, where his teams - during the years when the Vietnam War made recruiting for West Point difficult - won 102 games and lost 50. He is one of five coaches who have won seven hundred games, and the only coach whose teams have won championships in the NCAA tournament, the National Invitation Tournament, the Olympic Games and the Pan American Games.During all that he has been at the heart of more controversies while running a winning and squeaky-clean program than any coach of any sport any time or anywhere.His excitement as things start anew for him is matched here by his candor and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, with story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull: the story of Bob Knight's life.",

    "description": "Unlike regimented football or stats-happy baseball, The National Basketball Association is above all else a league of characters. Over the course of a season, games are, of course, won or lost, but for millions of devoted fans, the final result is almost incidental to the way the league's best players perform on - and off - the court. This book is the indispensible companion to today's game - a roundball Rosetta Stone that hilariously decodes the trends and tendencies of this enormously popular game. The NBA of the moment is a league of hugely charismatic celebrities, crackling aesthetic intrigue, socio-political undercurrents, and raw humanity: every Kobe Bryant pump-fake or LeBron James dunk symbolizes the changing landscape of professional sports and holds within it a Shaq-sized load of meaning. Fans who know the sport recognize how much more there is to basketball than, well, basketball. The Macro-Phenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac is a brilliantly illustrated guide to this tumultuous and exciting landscape. It explains what each player--from Tim Duncan and Gilbert Arenas to Amare Stoudemire and Lamar Odom--reveals, through their play and conduct, about who they are and, more importantly, who the fans want them to be. Like the game it celebrates, The Macro-Phenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac is simultaneously authentic and cerebral, funny and accessible, wholly original, and always entertaining.",

Perhaps no one personifies the excitement of this tournament better than Jim Valvano, whose heavily underdog North Carolina State Wolfpack achieved the pinnacle of success in college basketball in 1983 with an unlikely run through the NCAA Tournament, culminating in an incredible one-point victory over Houston's heavily favored Phi Slamma Jamma squad in the championship game.While that Cinderella story was Valvano's only national championship, he quickly came to symbolize the exuberance and excellence of the exciting world of college basketball. Valvano transcended his sport, touching millions as he emerged as one of the most charismatic and, ultimately, courageous figures in American life who touched millions.Diagnosed with bone cancer, he joined ESPN to comment on college basketball games. Later he received the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at ESPN's first ESPY Awards, where he announced that he was starting the V Foundation for Cancer Research. Shortly after receiving the award, he died at the age of forty-seven. In I Remember Jim Valvano, he is remembered by former players, fellow coaches, a variety of other basketball experts, close associates, and many others as one of college basketball's great movers and shakers, a man with a heart as big as his popularity. Valvano's life is the classic story of courage and determination as borne out in his memorable line: Don't give up. Don't ever give up\"\".\"\"",

    "description": "In the late \u201990s and early 2000s, the Portland Trail Blazers were one of the hottest teams in the NBA. For almost a decade, they won 60 percent of their games while making it to the Western Conference Finals twice. However, what happened off-court was just as unforgettable as what they did on the court. When someone asked Blazers general manager Bob Whitsitt about his team\u2019s chemistry, he replied that he\u2019d \u201cnever studied chemistry in college.\u201d And with that, the \u201cJail Blazers\u201d were born. Built in a similar fashion to a fantasy team, the team had skills, but their issues ended up being their undoing. In fact, many consider it the darkest period in franchise history. While fans across the country were watching the skills of Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace, and Zach Randolph, those in Portland couldn\u2019t have been more disappointed in the players\u2019 off-court actions. This, many have mentioned, included a very racial element\u2015which carried over to the players as well. As forward Rasheed Wallace said, \u201cWe\u2019re not really going to worry about what the hell [the fans] think about us. They really don\u2019t matter to us. They can boo us every day, but they\u2019re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That\u2019s why they\u2019re fans and we\u2019re NBA players.\u201d While people think of the Detroit Pistons of the eighties as the elite \u201cBad Boys,\u201d the \u201cJail Blazers\u201d were actually bad. Author Kerry Eggers, who covered the Trail Blazers during this controversial era, goes back to share the stories from the players, coaches, management, and those in Portland when the players were in the headlines as much for their play as for their legal issues.",

With the possible exceptions of boxer Muhammad Ali and baseball player Babe Ruth, no athlete has made a greater impact on American society-or in the world-than Michael Jordan. Follow the life of one of the most recognizable athletes and living brands inside this engaging and balanced biography.When basketball stars Larry Bird and Magic Johnson retired in the early 1990s, Michael almost single-handedly propelled the NBA to stratospheric levels of success and international visibility. As a player for the Chicago Bulls, he generated instant crowd thrills with his record-setting drives and dunks, selling countless books, newspapers, videotapes, NBA game tickets, and hours of television time. The NBA promoted Michael, basing its popularity on his image as the greatest showman in sports history. Yet his sports hero status extends beyond NBA records. Michael changed the game by becoming the most effectively marketed athlete of his generation. Nike and many other companies rode-and continue to ride-on the coattails of Air Jordan's legend. Author David Porter highlights Jordan's on and off the court accomplishments and examines his relationship with Chicago Bulls' coaches, his commercial endorsements, and his current role as part-owner of the Charlotte Bobcats. A chronology, photos, career stats, and a bibliography of print and electronic resources round out this biography of one of the most influential athletes of the twentieth century.",

    "description": "A provocative and revelatory new biography of the legendary UCLA coach John Wooden, by one of America's top college basketball writersNo college basketball coach has ever dominated the sport like John Wooden. His UCLA teams reached unprecedented heights in the 1960s and '70s capped by a run of ten NCAA championships in twelve seasons and an eighty-eight-game winning streak, records that stand to this day. Wooden also became a renowned motivational speaker and writer, revered for his \"Pyramid of Success.\"Seth Davis of Sports Illustrated and CBS Sports has written the definitive biography of Wooden, an unflinching portrait that draws on archival research and more than two hundred interviews with players, opponents, coaches, and even Wooden himself. Davis shows how hard Wooden strove for success, from his All-American playing days at Purdue through his early years as a high school and college coach to the glory days at UCLA, only to discover that reaching new heights brought new burdens and frustrations. Davis also reveals how at the pinnacle of his career Wooden found himself on questionable ground with alumni, referees, assistants, and even some of his players. His was a life not only of lessons taught, but also of lessons learned.Woven into the story as well are the players who powered Wooden's championship teams \u2013 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Walt Hazzard, and others \u2013 many of whom speak frankly about their coach. The portrait that emerges from Davis's remarkable biography is of a man in full, whose life story still resonates today.",

Succeeding James Naismith as the University of Kansas\u2019s basketball coach in 1907, Allen led the Jayhawks for thirty-nine seasons and holds the record for most wins at that school, with 590. He also helped create the NCAA tournament and brought basketball to the Olympics. Allen changed the way the game is played, coached, marketed, and presented. Scott Morrow Johnson reveals Allen as a master recruiter, a transformative coach, and a visionary basketball mind. Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Wilt Chamberlain, and many others benefited from Allen\u2019s knowledge of and passion for the game.

The Jayhawks success in 2007-2008 has been credited to total team effort and the inspiring leadership of head coach Bill Self. During his relatively short head coaching career, Self has established himself as one of college basketball's best by leading Oral Roberts to new frontiers, guiding Tulsa to its best season in school history, turning Illinois into a Big Ten powerhouse and now taking Kansas from a perennially great program to the best in the nation. In Bill Self's first authorized book: BILL SELF: At Home in the Phog, Self and those who know him best offer an inside look at his journey into becoming one of the game's most respected and most sought-after coaches. Self explains how he is living a dream - not only is he a head coach, but he was selected to be the steward of what James Naismith and Phog Allen created. He describes the excitement of reaching the pinnacle - leading the Jayhawks to a national title. He gives minute-by-minute details of the contest that sent KU to the national title game. Self has achieved his dream of becoming a head coach. That much is evident. Even though he never dreamed of being the head coach at the University of Kansas, he did aspire to lead a college basketball team to greatness, which is exactly what he is doing. Self's journey proves that even though dreams may change, they can come true.",

With this memorable book, Phil joins his friend Charley Rosen, a former player and coach who knows success at the game's highest levels, to bring new insight to the challenge of coaching and to honor the innate grace of basketball and its players.  Jackson and Rosen take you from the cracked blacktop courts of the inner city to the polished hardwood of the country's finest arenas, exposing the demanding reality of professional basketball: a world of glamour, glitter, and greed, in which nobility can still be found in the single-minded pursuit of athletic perfection.  From his playing days in college and with the world champion Knicks of the 1970's to his victories courtside with the Bulls and the Lakers, Jackson relates his philosophy of coaching, fondly talks about the memorable players and plays of the past, and candidly expresses his feelings about today's rules and referees.

Why? Because Dennis Rodman, superstar&nbsp;&nbsp;basketball player who joined the Chicago Bulls for the&nbsp;&nbsp;1996 season, has more in common with Mick Jagger&nbsp;&nbsp;than with his new teammate Michael Jordan.

Naismith, who had invented the game, had peach baskets nailed below a walkway that happened to be 10-feet high. Within a few days, one of Naismith's students would christen the new game \"Basket Ball.\"Over a century ago, no one could possibly have envisioned the extraordinary changes that were going to transform Dr. Naismith's game. Who could have imagined a 6-10 George Mikan swatting shots away from the basket? Julius Erving in flight, soaring in from the free throw line for a heart-stopping stuff? Or Bob Cousy throwing a mind-boggling no-look, behind-the-back pass; Jerry West hitting a 60-foot shot with no time left in a crucial playoff game; Larry Bird's three-point prowess and Michael Jordan rising to heights - literally and figuratively - never before seen by any athlete? Who could have foreseen more than 62,000 fans crowded into the Georgia Dome to see a game between the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks? Or the titanic battles between Wilt and Russell? Or the Dream Team? The longevity of Stockton and Malone? Red Auerbach's victory cigars? Phil Jackson's Zen coaching? Or Shaquille O'Neal's powerful dunks? Who could have ever predicted talent like Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, Walt Frazier, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Grant Hill, Vince Carter, Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, and Kobe Bryant?With an Introduction by NBA Commissioner David J.

Beginning with the arrival of Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson as the number-one overall pick of the 1979 draft, the Lakers played basketball with gusto and pizzazz, unleashing their famed \u201cShowtime\u201d run-and-gun style on a league unprepared for their speed and ferocity\u2014and became the most captivating show in sports and, arguably, in all-around American entertainment.

    "description": "Pro basketball player Rasheed Wallace often exclaimed the pragmatic truth \u201cBall don\u2019t lie!\u201d during a game. It is a protest against a referee\u2019s bad calls. But the slogan, which originated in pickup games, brings the reality of a racialized urban playground into mainstream American popular culture.&nbsp;In Ball Don\u2019t Lie!, Yago Col\u00e1s traces the various forms of power at work in the intersections between basketball and language from the game\u2019s invention to the present day. He critiques existing popular myths concerning the history of basketball, contextualizes them, and presents an alternative history of the sport inspired by innovations. Col\u00e1s emphasizes the creative prerogative of players and the ways in which their innovations shape\u2014and are shaped by\u2014broader cultural and social phenomena.Ball Don't Lie!&nbsp;shows that basketball cannot be reduced to a single, fixed or timeless essence but instead is a continually evolving exhibition of physical culture that flexibly adapts to and sparks changes in American society.",

    "description": "After the Boston Celtics made University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft on June 17, the player\u2019s future lay in front of him like a golden, red carpet leading to a life of good-fortuned fame. The Celtics and others considered him to be the next great basketball star, following Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, at a time when the team returned to league supremacy and Michael Jordan had yet to establish his ultimate greatness. Bias played with a rare mix of athleticism, grace and controlled rage. Off the court, he was humble and personable, shy and at times socially adventurous and daring. But Bias\u2019 death from cocaine intoxication two days after the draft altered the state of sports and drugs in a way that lingers today. The player\u2019s death was one of the cruelest tragedies in sports in the last quarter century. It still strikes the hearts and minds of many in a generation that witnessed the uncomfortable and developing synergy of big time sports and drug abuse. I tried to humanize the story by focusing on how lives have been affected by his death and the compelling issues that have arisen from the tragedy. The book provides an underlying message of overcoming tragedy to thrive and, in some cases, just to survive, in life. Bias\u2019s death forced American lawmakers to make tough choices about how to best deal with a developing drug crisis, with dubious consequences. It reinforced efforts by those in charge of administering college athletics to alter the way they guided student athletes. And Bias\u2019 death drastically changed the destinies of many who were closely connected to the athlete. The book includes interviews with Bias's teammates and close friends; former University of Maryland athletics officials who reflect on the challenging years that followed his death; people who were greatly affected by federal drugs laws; and even a young man who claims to be his son. I talked with his mother as well. As a former University of Maryland athlete (track and field and soccer) and a long-time Washington, D.C.-based journalist, I approached this project with passion and a unique perspective. I reported on Bias\u2019 death in 1986 as a community broadcaster while also working at the Washington Post. This is my third book on athletics history at the University of Maryland, where i was a two sport athlete in track and field in soccer. I was captain of the track team in 1979-80.

    "product_name": "Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era",
    "description": "On the night of March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, right up the street from the chocolate factory, Wilt Chamberlain, a young and striking athlete celebrated as the Big Dipper, scored one hundred points in a game against the New York Knickerbockers.As historic and revolutionary as the achievement was, it remains shrouded in myth. The game was not televised; no New York sportswriters showed up; and a fourteen-year-old local boy ran onto the court when Chamberlain scored his hundredth point, shook his hand, and then ran off with the basketball. In telling the story of this remarkable night, author Gary M. Pomerantz brings to life a lost world of American sports.In 1962, the National Basketball Association, stepchild to the college game, was searching for its identity. Its teams were mostly white, the number of black players limited by an unspoken quota. Games were played in drafty, half-filled arenas, and the players traveled on buses and trains, telling tall tales, playing cards, and sometimes reading Joyce. Into this scene stepped the unprecedented Wilt Chamberlain: strong and quick-witted, voluble and enigmatic, a seven-footer who played with a colossal will and a dancer\u2019s grace. That strength, will, grace, and mystery were never more in focus than on March 2, 1962. Pomerantz tracked down Knicks and Philadelphia Warriors, fans, journalists, team officials, other NBA stars of the era, and basketball historians, conducting more than 250 interviews in all, to recreate in painstaking detail the game that announced the Dipper\u2019s greatness. He brings us to Hershey, Pennsylvania, a sweet-seeming model of the gentle, homogeneous small-town America that was fast becoming anachronistic. We see the fans and players, alternately fascinated and confused by Wilt, drawn anxiously into the spectacle. Pomerantz portrays the other legendary figures in this story: the Warriors\u2019 elegant coach Frank McGuire; the beloved, if rumpled, team owner Eddie Gottlieb; and the irreverent p.a. announcer Dave \u201cthe Zink\u201d Zinkoff, who handed out free salamis courtside.At the heart of the book is the self-made Chamberlain, a romantic cosmopolitan who owned a nightclub in Harlem and shrugged off segregation with a bebop cool but harbored every slight deep in his psyche. March 2, 1962, presented the awesome sight of Wilt Chamberlain imposing himself on a world that would diminish him. Wilt, 1962 is not only the dramatic story of a singular basketball game but a meditation on small towns, midcentury America, and one of the most intriguing figures in the pantheon of sports heroes. Also available as a Random House AudioBookFrom the Hardcover edition.",

And since the NBA has only so many positions, most of you know that overseas ball is a stronger possibility for you to continue your playing career, and it is: The NBA has 450 job positions while there are 10,000 players employed internationally (which includes Canada, Central and South America, which technically do not require going \u201cover a sea\u201d to get to, in case you cared). Over the years I have compiled several guides and tips for players on how to get their careers started, what to expect on the way and once they are in the door, and how to handle themselves with the on and off-court situations that come with it. Every guide comes from questions that players frequently ask me. This guidebook is a compilation of all those help &amp; tips in one place for your quick and easy reference, which I will be updating over time as new questions come up and new information arises. If you take only one thing from this guidebook, know that professional basketball is a buyer\u2019s market: There are more candidates than there are jobs, so the people who do the hiring \u2014 the teams themselves \u2014 have the power.

    "description": "A Choice Significant University Press Title for Undergraduates, 2010\u201311.From Accra and Algiers to Zanzibar and Zululand, Africans have wrested control of soccer from the hands of Europeans, and through the rise of different playing styles, the rituals of spectatorship, and the presence of magicians and healers, have turned soccer into a distinctively African activity.African Soccerscapes explores how Africans adopted soccer for their own reasons and on their own terms. Soccer was a rare form of \u201cnational culture\u201d in postcolonial Africa, where stadiums and clubhouses became arenas in which Africans challenged colonial power and expressed a commitment to racial equality and self-determination. New nations staged matches as part of their independence cele\u00adbrations and joined the world body, FIFA. The Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration africaine de football democratized the global game through antiapartheid sanctions and increased the number of African teams in the World Cup finals. In this compact, highly readable book Alegi shows that the result of this success has been the departure of huge numbers of players to overseas clubs and the growing influence of private commercial interests on the African game. But the growth of women\u2019s soccer and South Africa\u2019s hosting of the 2010 World Cup also challenge the one-dimensional notion of Africa as a backward, \u201ctribal\u201d continent populated by victims of war, corruption, famine, and disease.",

Hell, he\u2019s even played in the real Siberia. And in Can I Keep My Jersey?, Shirley finally puts down roots long enough to deliver one of the great locker-room chronicles of the modern age. With sharp elbows and an even sharper wit, Shirley\u2013whose writings have been described as \u201cwildly entertaining\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2013drops hilarious commentary, revealing which teams have the best cheerleaders (he\u2019s spent many a time-out watching them ply their trade), why Christ is rapidly becoming every team\u2019s \u201csixth man,\u201d and even the best ways to get bloodstains out of your game uniform, using only an ordinary bar of soap and a hotel bathroom sink.From sharing the court with Kobe and Shaq to perusing the food court at some mall in a bush-league burg; from taking pregame layups to getting laid out by a stray knee from an NBA power forward; from hopping a limo to the team\u2019s charter jet to dashing to catch the van home from a B-league game in Tijuana, Shirley dishes on what it\u2019s like to try to make it as a professional athlete. Can I Keep My Jersey? is a rollicking, thoughtful, even thought-provoking insider\u2019s look at a pro baller\u2019s life on the fringe.

Their nickname, the Rhythm Boys, captured who they were and what they did on the court. Led by star center Dwaine Dillard, the Rhythm Boys were a shoo-in to win the state championship. But something happened on their way to glory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In early March, segregationist George Wallace, in a third-party presidential bid, made a campaign stop in Omaha. By the time he left town, Dillard was in jail, his coach was caught between angry political factions, and the city teetered on the edge of racial violence. So began the Nebraska state high school basketball tournament the next day, caught in the vise of history. The Rhythm Boys of Omaha Central tells a true story about high school basketball, black awakening and rebellion, and innocence lost in a watershed year. The drama of civil rights in 1968 plays out in this riveting social history of sports, politics, race, and popular culture in the American heartland.",

Participating in the new game was a quick and enjoyable way to become Americanized. Jews not only dominated the sport for the next fifty\u2011plus years but were also instrumental in modernizing the game. Barney Sedran was considered the best player in the country at the City College of New York from 1909 to 1911.&nbsp;In 1927 Abe Saperstein took over management of the Harlem Globetrotters, playing a key role in popularizing and integrating the game. Later he helped found the American Basketball Association and introduced the three-point shot.&nbsp;More recently, Nancy Lieberman played in a men\u2019s pro summer league and became the first woman to coach a men\u2019s pro team, and Larry Brown became the only coach to win both NCAA and the NBA championships. While the influence of Jewish players, referees, coaches, and administrators has gradually diminished since the mid\u20111950s, the current basketball scene features numerous Jews in important positions. Through interviews and lively anecdotes from franchise owners, coaches,&nbsp;players, and referees, The&nbsp;Chosen Game explores&nbsp;the contribution of Jews to the evolution of present-day pro&nbsp;basketball. &nbsp;",

He saw the exceptional play on the basketball court and the surprising poise with which LeBron has handled the pressure, the scrutiny, the criticism that arrived with the early onset of fame.The odds were against James from the start. Born in poverty to a 16-year-old single mom, without a stable home for the first decade of his life, LeBron could have become just one more scarred product of a rough childhood in the projects. Instead, he became the darling of the sports world\u2015and he plays the part well.He was called the best high school basketball player ever. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated as a junior, was featured on national television, and signed more than $100 million in promotional contracts before the end of his senior year. It was no surprise when he became the no-doubt-about-it No. 1 pick in the NBA draft right after high school graduation.This is a story for any fan who wants to get to know LeBron better, and for anyone curious about how a high-school basketball phenom is made.

    "description": "In February 2002, high school junior and two-time state champion LeBron James, an Ohio wonder on the cusp of national stardom, appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the words \"The Chosen One.\" Basketball would never be the same again.And yet, a coach and his team of relative unknowns at St. Bernard Roger Bacon, a Catholic high school in Cincinnati, didn't seem to notice. A little over a month later, Roger Bacon faced LeBron and seemingly invincible Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary in perhaps the most highly anticipated state final in Ohio history. The Chosen Ones: The Team That Beat LeBron tells the untold story of struggle and triumph, of setback and success, of tragedy and redemption of the only Ohio prep basketball team to ever beat LeBron James. With honesty and humanity, first-time author Tony Meale reveals how a group of young men, driven by their coach, forged a brotherhood and fearlessness that produced one of the most inspiring underdog stories the sports world has ever witnessed.Editorial Reviews\"Tony was fascinated by (Bacon's) accomplishment and how it had taken place. You will be, too.\" - Brian Windhorst, ESPN.com\"This is Hoosiers meets Remember the Titans.\" - John Erardi, Enquirer\"Tony Meale has told (this) story with such a keen eye and with such intimate detail that the stunning result has finally started to make sense.\"\u2028- Tim Sullivan, Courier-Journal\"The last game of (LeBron's) junior year forever changed the lives of a bunch of no-name kids from Cincinnati.

His rep on the court traveled all the way to the Bronx, and across the country, earning him enthusiastic comparisons to the likes of Magic Johnson. Swee\u2019pea was sure to make it to the big time and out of a New York City where drugs and violence had gripped many of its neighborhoods. And eventually he did, leaving the city\u2019s asphalt courts for the shiny hardwoods of NCAA programs, minor pro-leagues, and eventually the NBA.  He took with him, however, a drug habit, a learning disability, and a reputation for self-destruction.  With Swee\u2019pea, Newsday reporter John Valenti and celebrated New York City high school basketball coach Ron Naclerio brilliantly capture how an athletic phenom becomes both a product of his environment, and his own worst enemy. Supplementing Daniels\u2019s enigmatic story are profiles of basketball successes like former NBA stars Kenny Anderson, John Salley, and Mark Jackson\u2014and tragedies like Earl \u201cThe Goat\u201d Manigault, Richie Adams, and Tony \u201cRed\u201d Bruin\u2014who never made the league.  Timeless, gritty, and hard-hitting, Swee\u2019pea is a classic tale that illuminates why so many of basketball's best players throw away multimillion dollar careers, and a journey back to a time when the humble playground courts of New York City were giving rise to some of the finest players in the world.",

In Steve Kerr: The Inspiring Life and Leadership Lessons of One of Basketball's Greatest Coaches, you will learn the story of one of basketball's premier coaches, Steve Kerr. Since joining the Warriors organization in the summer of 2014, Steve Kerr has catapulted the Golden State Warriors to become a perennial championship contender. He has demonstrated admirable leadership in his ability to create a sustainable system where players play like family and have fun. Some could argue the Golden State Warriors' approach to basketball is an evolution of what has made the San Antonio Spurs so successful for two decades. It is disciplined, yet loose at the same time. While he is still early in his coaching career, Steve Kerr will undoubtedly go down as one of the most effective coaches of all time when he retires, mainly because of his ability to relate to his players and maintain their composure in the most clutch in-game moments. There are a number of key leadership lessons that can be learned from Steve Kerr, such as maintaining your humility, maximizing the potential of each individual player, and communicating often with your team. Whether you're a basketball player or a coach looking for inspiration, this book will help you discover the incredible story of Steve Kerr and the many leadership lessons that can be learned from studying his success. Here is a preview of what is inside this book:  Background and History NBA Career as a Player Life After the NBA Steve Kerr's Head Coaching Career What Makes Steve Kerr a Good Leader How Steve Kerr Maximizes Player Potential What is Steve Kerr's System Key Takeaways Conclusion and Steve Kerr's Legacy  An excerpt from the book: Rarely do NBA head coaches immediately make an impact in the league where all the greatest minds in basketball coach the best athletes of the sport. It takes months or even years to try to convince the players and entire organization to buy into the system you seek to sell. It would take even longer to perfect that system while several other teams in the league are brandishing strategies and plays they have been using for several years already.  What is even more difficult is to try to lead a young team that has minimal playoff experience on your first stint as a coach at any level of basketball. But the Golden State Warriors' Steve Kerr did it. He immediately made an impact in a league that already had established title favorites coming into his first season as a head coach of the Warriors. He would shake the heads of contenders, critics, and fans alike by leading a young and inexperienced Golden State Warriors to a remarkable 67-15 regular season record and an eventual NBA title in his first season.

He influenced future NBA All Stars such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and is considered by many to be one of the most important players in NBA history. A prolific scorer who baffled opponents with his twists and turns and inventive moves, Baylor was a force both on and off the court for the Minneapolis and Los Angeles Lakers.

Bayne tells the story of how a kid from the streets of segregated Washington, DC, who didn\u2019t attend college until he was over twenty, revolutionized basketball and stood up for his rights. In a time when few nationally prominent black athletes spoke out about racial inequality in the United States, Baylor refused to tolerate discrimination. On the court, with his balletic moves and urban style of play, Elgin Baylor lifted the game of basketball off the floor and into the air. Elgin Baylor: The Man Who Changed Basketball includes personal reflections from Baylor\u2019s old schoolyard companions, former teammates, players he coached in the NBA, and noted sports journalists, bringing to life his childhood, college career, and professional life with intimate detail.

    "product_name": "Barnstorming America Stories from the Pioneers of Women's Basketball",
    "description": "In an era when women had only recently been given the right to vote and the Great Depression made jobs of any kind hard to come by, American women of the 1930s faced an uphill battle when it came to accessing opportunities to work outside the home.  About the same time, the relatively-new sport of basketball was gaining popularity in America and its schools. Girls were allowed to play basketball, too, although the rules were modified to accommodate the lack of strength, stamina and selflessness of the \"weaker sex\" attributes deemed necessary to play basketball the way boys and men did. Many girls, however, excelled at basketball, to the extent that they wanted to keep playing after finishing high school. But apart from Amateur Athletic Union programs and the rare college teams, organized basketball after high school was out of reach of most women. Women's professional leagues were still four decades away from reality. But in 1936, entrepreneur and visionary C.M. \"Ole\" Olson, already in the barnstorming basketball business with his own men's traveling team, felt that not only were women ready to play basketball at a high level, but that people would turn out in large numbers to pay to see them play. From his home base in Cassville, Missouri, he recruited the best female basketball players he could find and formed the All American Red Heads the very first women's professional basketball team to hit America's roads and operate successfully. Playing against men's teams by men's rules, the Red Heads barnstormed across America, playing a grueling schedule of one-night stands and winning the vast majority of their games. Other barnstorming women's teams joined the Red Heads as barnstormers, including the Ozark Hill Billies, Arkansas Travelers, Texas Cowgirls, Southern Belles and others. In the years and decades that followed, these groundbreaking women dismantled the wall of gender stereotypes and barriers regarding women, each victory over men taking another brick out of the wall. Barnstorming America Stories of the Pioneers of Women's Basketball tells the story of the women who helped reshape America's attitudes toward women in sports and paved the way for today's professional women's leagues. Award-winning historian and author John Molina interviewed over 80 veterans of the barnstorming wars and their families, recording their experiences both on and off the court. The result is a treasure-trove of anecdotes and stories that paint a vivid picture of life as a professional women s basketball player something almost unthinkable before 1936.",

    "product_name": "Fast Breaks, Finger Rolls, and Fisticuffs: Memories of Big East Basketball",
    "description": "In 1979, Providence athletic director Dave Gavitt gifted the college basketball world a conference like no other. Much has been said about the unique brand of hoops played during the Big East\u2019s golden era, when football shared the entertainment throne and its specter had yet to hover over every other sport in America. However, very little of that dialogue has come from the mouths of the   players, the men who made the magic.  In Fast Breaks, Finger Rolls, and Fisticuffs: Memories of Big East Basketball, Mark Hostutler interviewed 50 alumni of the conference\u2019s first decade and a half to compile its oral history from the players\u2019 perspectives. Whatever the moment \u2014 Georgetown\u2019s national title in 1984, Villanova\u2019s the next year, Jerome Lane\u2019s glass-rupturing dunk, Syracuse\u2019s unlikely runs to the final in 1987 and 1996, or Boston College\u2019s shocking upset of defending-champion North Carolina in the 1994 NCAA Tournament \u2014 Hostutler spoke with someone who experienced it.  Connecticut\u2019s Chris Smith, Seton Hall\u2019s Terry Dehere, Villanova\u2019s Doug West and Kerry Kittles, Felipe Lopez of St. John\u2019s, Boston College\u2019s Bill Curley, and Syracuse\u2019s Rony Seikaly, Lawrence Moten, and John Wallace are among the many who shared their stories of being on the inside. These men help fans relive the Big East\u2019s notorious battles of attrition, the violence of its post play, and the ball-handling exhibitions and perimeter-scoring displays that transcended some of the most physical, suffocating defenses in the country.  Although the Big East has recently survived the football-dictated, tectonic shift of the NCAA\u2019s terrain with its original, basketball-centric ethos intact, what remains are just the fossils of the greatest alliance in college basketball history. This book turns back the clock, transporting readers to a time when the best players in America treated the college campus as their second home and not just a brief stop along their path to the NBA.",

Rick Telander, a young photojournalist and former high school basketball player, spent part of the summer of 1973 and all of the summer of 1974 in Brooklyn living the playground life with his subjects at Foster Park in Flatbush. He slept on the floor of a park regular\u2019s apartment, observing, questioning, traveling and playing with, and eventually coaching a ragtag group of local teenagers whose hopes of better lives were often fanatically attached to the transcendent game itself.&nbsp;At times little separates the author and his subjects, both of whom are emotionally linked by their passion for hoops. But as the summer unfolds and even superstars such as the legendary and incendiary Fly Williams are confronted with the realities of ghetto life and the sociological hurdles facing African American males, the joy of the game starts to be seen as the wispy pipe dream it often becomes. Written before cell phones, disposable cameras, and cable TV, Heaven Is a Playground is one of a kind\u2014a funny, sad, ultimately inspiring book&nbsp;about Americans and the roots of the sport that they love.&nbsp;In this third edition, thirty-five years after Telander discovered New York\u2019s kings of basketball, the author provides a retrospective of the game and times.",

In the process, it takes a sober look at minor league professional basketball, as Cunningham tries to navigate a poor relationship with his coach and yet finish his career on his own terms by playing a final season and winning a championship.As UNDERBELLY HOOPS shows, the CBA was a realm where hopeful players desperately hung on and crusty motels might very well have no clocks. It was a place where a trainer could be ordered to fill the visiting team's cooler with warm shower water and a coach might tell a player (namely, Cunningham) that he was focusing too much on his marriage and child rather than basketball. It was also a place where entire hotel wings could become saturated with the pungent smell of marijuana. And yet, even as it chipped away at your dignity and made little economic sense to remain, the CBA drew you in with the allure of action and the prospect of an NBA call-up. And it could inspire, like when you and your teammates caught a rhythm that made you remember why basketball is such a beautiful game, or when you saw guys continue to strive, to persevere, even if their dreams weren't fully realized.\"The hoops answer to Ball Four. By turns funny and poignant\u2015and always self aware\u2015this book allows fans into the locker room and huddle, yes, but also into the cortex of a professional basketball player.

Think Orange and the memories of 1,607 victories are stirred, from SU\u2019s first win in 1901 over Cornell to its 2003 triumph over Kansas that brought home the national championship. Many of the stories that have contributed to the phenomenon known as Orangemen basketball now come to life in Bud Poliquin\u2019s updated edition of Tales from the Syracuse Orange's Locker Room.  Dave Bing, Jim Boeheim, Jim Brown (yes, he played hoops, too), Bouie and Louie, Leo Rautins, Pearl Washington, and Derrick Coleman\u2014all of them and numerous other SU legends join Hanson and Anthony in the pages of this anecdotal anthology of Syracuse University basketball, certain to complete the bookshelf of any Orange fan. This book looks at the team\u2019s infamous 27-game losing streak in the early 1960s; Roy\u2019s Runts; the Pearl\u2019s stunning half-court buzzer-beater that knocked off Boston College in 1984; the fabulous Final Four runs of 1975, 1996, 2003, 2013, and 2016; and Anthony\u2019s freshman brilliance that delivered the school\u2019s first-ever NCAA tournament title in 2006.

Leonard takes readers inside the Indiana locker room with legendary head coach Branch McCracken and onto the court when he hit the deciding free throws as the \"Hurrying Hoosiers\" topped Phog Allen's Kansas Jayhawks. He recalls the NBA's early years, including being drafted by a Baltimore Bullets team that folded soon after selecting him. He tells of his time as the winningest coach in the ABA's nine-year history, securing three championships in his first five seasons with the Indianapolis Pacers. In his final act, \"Slick\" endeared himself to new generations of Hoosier hoops fans as the longtime Pacers radio voice, with his trademark call \"Boom, Baby!\" for a successful three-point shot.",

    "product_name": "Chasing Perfection: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the High-Stakes Game of Creating an NBA Champion",
    "description": "Chasing Perfection goes behind the scenes of the multi-million dollar, high-stakes world of basketball player development, research and analysis, and the often secretive, cutting-edge methods that NBA franchises use to turn less-expensive, supporting players into vital parts of championship teams.NBA superstars push as close to perfection as we're likely to see, but they are few and far between. The farther you get from the league's top echelon of talent, the more it's up to the players\u2014and their teams\u2014to develop and utilize their strengths while diminishing and masking their weaknesses as much as possible. There are no perfect basketball players, but there are plenty of perfected ones, who start with a basis of skill and physical ability and then are refined further and further in order to move closer and closer to their absolute potential.In Chasing Perfection, national sportswriter Andy Glockner reveals that, though the concept of player improvement is as old as basketball itself, the current era of Big Data analytics in the NBA is transforming that process more quickly and aggressively than anything we have seen before. Players are learning more and more about themselves through video and data visualization, seeing how things like diet and sleep can impact their performance, and learning how having healthy joints and role-specific workout plans are lengthening and improving their careers. Teams are internalizing the same lessons, as well as figuring out how to better implement optimal on-court strategies, how to refine their approaches to player acquisition and how to gauge the varying values and success rates of different, crucial team-building strategies.It's an absolutely fascinating time to be a fan, as the marriage of basketball and technology is bringing two of our most popular and competitive worlds together in compelling fashion. Using the 2014\u201315 NBA season as a prism to explore this mesh of sport and science, Glockner offers detailed perspective from NBA players, coaches, team management, and media, offering a comprehensive insider's view of how analytics are shaping the basketball we watch, and how those who are lagging behind in the technology race already are feeling the competitive hit.",

They had seen the \u201cMiracle in Richfield\u201d in 1976, \u201cThe Shot\u201d by Michael Jordan to knock them out of the playoffs in 1989, the arrival of \u201cThe Chosen One,\u201d LeBron James, in 2003, and a trip to the NBA Finals in 2007, but never a title.  All In: The Story of LeBron James and the 2016 NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers takes readers on the rollercoaster ride from LeBron coming back to Cleveland, to their 2015 NBA Finals appearance, through the unforgettable 2015\u201316 season that gave the city of Cleveland their first major sports championship in fifty-two years.

LeBron James finally earned his long-awaited redemption, Kevin Love made his presence felt under the boards, Kyrie Irving took to the NBA\u2019s biggest stage and made it his own under the brightest of lights, and J.

Using in-depth profile, revealing anecdote, and keen analysis, he chronicles the colorful University of Massachusetts basketball teams of the sixties and seventies that included legendary figures Julius Erving and Rick Pitino, then describes the eighties squads that plunged to embarrassing levels, only to be rescued by a charismatic coach named John Calipari.Ranked 259th of 267 Division I teams in the eighties, UMass rose to the top. The ascent culminated in 1995-96, a season in which the Minutemen reached the Final Four and spent most of the year ranked Number 1. Calipari earned national Coach of the Year honors, and star player Marcus Camby was tapped Player of the Year.UMass enjoyed the considerable spoils of its success, but also paid a price. During the Calipari years, the team was rocked by controversy: a much-publicized grades scandal, the infamous \"John Chaney incident,\" and the dismissal of Mike Williams - a clutch player for the ages. Following the magical 1995-96 season, Camby made a wrenching confession about his illegal entanglement with agents, and Calipari took his resurrection act on the road, signing a fat contract to coach the New Jersey Nets.Dobrow provides the most penetrating profiles ever written about Calipari, Camby, and his UMass teammates, while at the same time exploring the complexities of an obscure program gaining fame.",

The game, played in the middle of the racially turbulent 1960s\u2014part David and Goliath in short pants, part emancipation proclamation of college basketball\u2014helped destroy stereotypes about black athletes. Filled with revealing anecdotes, The Baron and the Bear is the story of two intensely passionate coaches and the teams they led through the ups and downs of a college basketball season. In the twilight of his legendary career, Kentucky\u2019s Adolph Rupp (\u201cThe Baron of the Bluegrass\u201d) was seeking his fifth NCAA championship. Texas Western\u2019s Don Haskins (\u201cThe Bear\u201d to his players) had been coaching at a small West Texas high school just five years before the championship. After this history-making game, conventional wisdom that black players lacked the discipline to win without a white player to lead began to dissolve. Northern schools began to abandon unwritten quotas limiting the number of blacks on the court at one time. Southern schools, where athletics had always been a whites-only activity, began a gradual move toward integration. &nbsp; David Kingsley Snell brings the season to life, offering fresh insights on the teams, the coaches, and the impact of the game on race relations in America. &nbsp;",

Some of the greatest players in NBA history have worn the Lakers jersey including Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Gail Goodrich, James Worthy and four of the NBA s Most Valuable Players Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O Neal and Kobe Bryant.

    "description": "This is the first book in a series of X's and O's basketball for the high school coaches. In this edition, you will find my favorite man-to-man offenses, including the highly effective FIST offense that has been my team's bread and butter man-to-man offense for over a decade. In this book you will get the step by step progressions of this offense that is designed to make an average post player shine by using five different screens across the court for each rotation through the offense. But the FIST offense is not all you will get in this book. You will get the basics of a numbered fast break that transitions into a secondary break that was the basis of our our offense the year we averaged 96 points per game. You will get three other offenses designed to get the ball inside to your post, one offense designed for a slashing wing, and another offense that uses the \"elevator screen to free up a three point shooter. In addition, this book details one of the best delay games I have ever seen that not only can run the clock, but score in a variety of means when the defense starts to cheat on the offense. Finally, I know most coaches have a variety of baseline out of bounds plays to run. Most coaches seem to play zone against the baseline out of bounds. But when they choose to go man-to-man in this situation, I teach my team only one play. It is by far the most effective man-to-man baseline out of bounds play I have ever seen. This play is included in this book.",

    "description": "Since 1990, Grant Hill has thrilled sports fans with his artistry on the basketball court, first as an All-American player at Duke University and then as a six-time NBA All-Star for the Detroit Pistons and the Orlando Magic. During these years, Hill has amassed a collection of art by African Americans that he now shares with the public through this book, which accompanies a traveling exhibition.\tThe forty-six pieces documented here include thirteen works that span the career of the great Romare Bearden, from his 1941 gouache painting Serenade to the important collages of the 1980s. Hill\u2019s fascination with artists\u2019 depiction of women is represented in Elizabeth Catlett\u2019s lithographs, many of them from the 1992 series \u201cFor My People,\u201d and her sculptures in stone, bronze, and onyx. In addition to these two giants of twentieth-century art, the Hill Collection features pieces by Phoebe Beasley, Arthello Beck Jr., John Biggers, Malcolm Brown, John Coleman, Edward Jackson, and Hughie Lee Smith.\tHill began collecting art in the early 1990s after learning from his parents to appreciate artworks not only as objects of beauty but as expressions of heritage and culture. According to the internationally known curator Alvia J. Wardlaw, he is part of an emerging group of young African American collectors who have \u201craised the bar for others.\u201d Hill writes, \u201cGetting to know yourself means understanding your background and appreciating those who have come before you. My father has a saying he uses in speeches: \u2018To be ignorant of your past is to remain a boy. \u2018The interest in my heritage as an African American is reflected in this collection.\u201d\tSomething All Our Own features Wardlaw\u2019s essay on the history of African American collecting. It also features articles about Bearden and Catlett by the scholars Elizabeth Alexander and Beverly Guy-Sheftall and reflections about Hill by the historian John Hope Franklin, Duke\u2019s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, and the sportswriter William C. Rhoden. Hill and his father, the NFL great Calvin Hill, contribute a dialogue that explores their motivations for collecting art.\tAt the heart of the book are the exquisite color photographs of the forty-six artworks included in the exhibition, with commentary by Wardlaw and by Hill himself.  As a star athlete, Grant Hill is well aware that African Americans who excel in sports and entertainment are more broadly recognized than their counterparts in artistic fields. He strives to inspire young people to explore their heritage and broaden their concept of excellence by learning more about African American art. By sharing his artworks with collectors and fans, Hill reminds us that while the jump shot is ephemeral, art is enduring.",

In 1976-77 he led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points, including a 68-point outburst in a game against the New York Knicks. \"\"Pistol Pete\"\" was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987.

They share the record for the most 20-win seasons. They are second in all-time number one rankings. And despite no longer holding the record for winningest coach, Adolph Rupp will always be a giant in the pantheon of college basketball.When The Winning Tradition first appeared in 1984, it was the first complete history of the Wildcat basketball program. Bert Nelli pointed out that, contrary to the accepted mythology, Adolph Rupp arrived at a program already strong and storied. Nor did Rupp bring an entirely new style of play to the Bluegrass. Instead he adopted\u2015and perfected\u2015that of his predecessor, John Mauer. What Rupp did bring was an ability to charm the news media and a fierce determination to turn out winning teams, making him the undisputed \"Baron of Basketball.\"This new and expanded edition of The Winning Tradition brings the history of Kentucky basketball up to date. Nelli and his son Steve turn the same unflinching gaze that characterized the honesty of the first edition on the scandals that marred Eddie Sutton's tenure, the return to glory under Rick Pitino, and a full accounting of Tubby Smith's history-making first year.The start of basketball season is welcomed in the Bluegrass with an unmatched enthusiasm and intensity. Each year brings a new team, new stars, and new glory. Other books have documented individual seasons, individual players, or individual coaches. But The Winning Tradition remains the only complete and authoritative history of the most celebrated college basketball program in the world.A book no fan can afford to be without, The Winning Tradition brings alive the agonies, frustrations, and glories of each season of Kentucky basketball, from the first team (fielded by women) to the surprising victory in the 1998 NCAA tournament.",

Inspired by young coach Jack Story and by the Harlem Globetrotters, the Cuba Cubs grabbed headlines when they rose from relative obscurity to defeat the big-city favorite and win the state championship.A classic underdog tale, The Graves County Boys chronicles how five boys from a tiny high school in southwestern Kentucky captured the hearts of basketball fans nationwide.

This inspiring David and Goliath story takes the reader on a journey from the team's heartbreaking defeat in the 1951 state championship to their triumphant victory over Louisville Manual the next year.More than just a basketball narrative, the book explores a period in American life when indoor plumbing and electricity were still luxuries in some areas of the country and when hardship was a way of life. With no funded school programs or bus system, the Cubs's success was a testament to the sacrifices of family and neighbors who believed in their team.

How did crossing lines of class, race, and wealth affect the lives of these ten boys? Two decades later, Doug Merlino, who played on the team, returned to find his teammates. The result is a complex, gripping, and at times unsettling story. An instant classic of narrative nonfiction, The Hustle tells the stories of ten teammates set before a background of sweeping social and economic change, capturing the ways race, money, and opportunity shape our lives.",

    "product_name": "Coaching Basketball: 30 Set Plays and Quick Hitters for the 1-4 High Alignment (Volume 3)",
    "description": "Why the 1-4 High? Why run all of your set plays, quick hitters or entry plays from a 1-4 high set? Good question. Here are the reasons this alignment is great for all set plays: Less is more. This one set keeps things simple for your players. It creates excellent spacing. Offense is all about good spacing. This alignment creates good scoring opportunities for every position. It is easy to create plays for any type of shot necessary from this alignment. The plays can be run to either side of the court simply by running the mirror image of the play. It is very easy to get into from a numbered fast break system. It denies the defense from establishing its defensive priorities, making this alignment difficult to defend from the onset. What are defensive priorities? Regardless of the type of defense run, most traditional defensive systems want to establish the following priorities: Be able to apply tremendous pressure on the ball and provide help to the on-the-ball defender. Be able to provide help in any situation. Protect the rim and low post areas. Force the ball out of the middle to one side to establish a ball side and help side, allowing the defense to outnumber the offense 5-3 by virtue of the two help defenders. Defend two offensive players with one defender if possible (usually a zone defense). Establish good inside positioning for defensive rebound coverage. Clog the lane area with help defenders to prevent lane penetration via pass, cut or dribble; low post entry passes;backdoor cuts for lay-ups. Some of the ways the 1-4 high alignment prevents the defense from establishing its priorities include preventing the defense from being able to establish a help side defense,forcing the defense away from the lane area and rim, opening the area up for penetration of one form or another, and requiring the defense to guard each offensive player, including the ball, with only one defender, and operating the offense from the middle of the court to initiate the attack. In addition to the advantages the 1-4 high set denies the defense, it is versatile due to the fact all of the plays can be run as mirror images. Any play depicted being run to the right hand side of the court can be run in its mirror image on the left hand side of the court. This short book contains 30 plays to attack man-to-man defenses, zone defenses, to obtain 3-point shots, low post shots, and on-the-ball screens to create penetration opportunities. These simple plays are an excellent way to score after a time out, a dead ball or as an entry to motion or other offenses.",

Similarly in Cougar football, coach Bill Yeoman recruited Warren McVea in 1964, and by 1967 McVea had helped the Houston gridiron program lead the nation in total offense. Houston Cougars in the 1960s features the first-person accounts of the players, the coaches, and others involved in the integration of collegiate athletics in Houston, telling the gripping story of the visionary coaches, the courageous athletes, and the committed supporters who blazed a trail not only for athletic success but also for racial equality in 1960s Houston.",

    "product_name": "Underdawgs: How Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs Marched Their Way to the Brink of College Basketball's National Championship",
    "description": "Butler University in Indianapolis became the smallest school in 40 years to reach the NCAA championship game. Prior to the tournament, a statistician calculated the Bulldogs as a 200-to-1 shot to win. But as fascinating as what Butler accomplished was how they did it. Underdawgs tells the incredible and uplifting story. Butler\u2019s coach, 33-year-old Brad Stevens, looked so young he was often mistaken for one of the players, but he had quickly become one of the best coaches in the nation by employing the \u201cButler Way.\u201d This philosophy of basketball and life, adopted by former coach Barry Collier, is based on five principles: humility, passion, unity, servanthood, and thankfulness. Even the most casual observer could see this in every player, on the court and off, from NBA first-round draft pick Gordon Hayward to the last guy on the bench. Butler was coming off a great 2009\u201310 regular season, but its longtime existence on the periphery of major college basketball fostered doubt as March Madness set in. But after two historic upsets, one of top-seeded Syracuse and another of second-seeded Kansas State, and making it to the Final Four, the Bulldogs came within the diameter of a shoelace of beating the perennial leaders of college basketball: the Duke Blue Devils. Much more than a sports story, Underdawgs is the consummate David versus Goliath tale. Despite Duke\u2019s winning the championship, the Bulldogs proved they belonged in the game and, in the process, won the respect of people who were not even sports fans.",

    "product_name": "Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association: The Real Story of a Team Left Behind",
    "description": "Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association: The Real Story of a Team Left Behind gives an inside look at one of the most intriguing times in the history of professional basketball; and the city of Louisville and the state of Kentucky were enjoying every bit of it. And then as quickly as the Colonels appeared, they were gone. They had been around just long enough to win a world championship and showcase not only some of the best basketball players in the history of the game, but also some of its most colorful characters. Perhaps this book should have been written years ago, but there always seemed to be plenty of time. And then one day, a generation or two removed, someone asked what happened to that pro-basketball team back in the 60s and 70s? BAM, it hits you. This book had to be written. Here are never-before-told stories that only Lloyd \"Pink\" Gardner would know. He lived it and Gary P. West wrote it.  A story of colorful owners with family connections to the Lindbergh kidnapping and Hope Diamond; sports agents who would do anything to sign players; a double murder and suicide; a businessman who thought he could do in basketball what he had done with Kentucky Fried Chicken; an insignificant T.V. deal that turned into hundreds of millions of dollars; a team that drafted a 5 6 , 55-year-old college professor; and through it all still won a world championship. Lloyd Gardner was a major part of the success of the Kentucky Colonels. Anyone who knows anything about the Kentucky Colonels and their history will tell you that. Lloyd had the perfect temperament to be a trainer, and the knowledge to get the players back after certain injuries, and the key thing of loyalty... to the players and the coaches.

    "product_name": "The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball",
    "description": "A BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN ACCOUNT OF THE NBA\u2019S GLORY DAYS, AND THE RIVALRY THAT DOMINATED THE ERAIn the mid-1950s, the NBA was a mere barnstorming circuit, with outposts in such cities as Rochester, New York, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. Most of the best players were white; the set shot and layup were the sport\u2019s chief offensive weapons. But by the 1970s, the league ruled America\u2019s biggest media markets; contests attracted capacity crowds and national prime-time television audiences. The game was played \u201cabove the rim\u201d\u2013and the most marketable of its high-flying stars were black. The credit for this remarkable transformation largely goes to two giants: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. In The Rivalry, award-winning journalist John Taylor projects the stories of Russell, Chamberlain, and other stars from the NBA\u2019s golden age onto a backdrop of racial tensions and cultural change. Taylor\u2019s electrifying account of two complex men\u2013as well as of a game and a country at a crossroads\u2013is an epic narrative of sports in America during the 1960s.It\u2019s hard to imagine two characters better suited to leading roles in the NBA saga: Chamberlain was cast as the athletically gifted yet mercurial titan, while Russell played the role of the stalwart centerpiece of the Boston Celtics dynasty. Taylor delves beneath these stereotypes, detailing how the two opposed and complemented each other and how they revolutionized the way the game was played and perceived by fans. Competing with and against such heroes as Jerry West, Tom Heinsohn, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, and Elgin Baylor, and playing for the two greatest coaches of the era, Alex Hannum and the fiery Red Auerbach, Chamberlain and Russell propelled the NBA into the spotlight. But their off-court visibility and success\u2013to say nothing of their candor\u2013also inflamed passions along America\u2019s racial and generational fault lines. In many ways, Russell and Chamberlain helped make the NBA and, to some extent, America what they are today.Filled with dramatic conflicts and some of the great moments in sports history, and building to a thrilling climax\u2013the 1969 final series, the last showdown between Russell and Chamberlain\u2013The Rivalry has at its core a philosophical question: Can determination and a team ethos, embodied by the ultimate team player, Bill Russell, trump sheer talent, embodied by Wilt Chamberlain? Gripping, insightful, and utterly compelling, the story of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain is the stuff of sporting legend. Written with a reporter\u2019s unerring command of events and a storyteller\u2019s flair, The Rivalry will take its place as one of the classic works of sports history.From the Hardcover edition.",

Most of the best players were white; the set shot and layup were the sport\u2019s chief offensive weapons. But by the 1970s, the league ruled America\u2019s biggest media markets; contests attracted capacity crowds and national prime-time television audiences. The game was played \u201cabove the rim\u201d\u2013and the most marketable of its high-flying stars were black. The credit for this remarkable transformation largely goes to two giants: Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. In The Rivalry, award-winning journalist John Taylor projects the stories of Russell, Chamberlain, and other stars from the NBA\u2019s golden age onto a backdrop of racial tensions and cultural change. Taylor\u2019s electrifying account of two complex men\u2013as well as of a game and a country at a crossroads\u2013is an epic narrative of sports in America during the 1960s.It\u2019s hard to imagine two characters better suited to leading roles in the NBA saga: Chamberlain was cast as the athletically gifted yet mercurial titan, while Russell played the role of the stalwart centerpiece of the Boston Celtics dynasty. Taylor delves beneath these stereotypes, detailing how the two opposed and complemented each other and how they revolutionized the way the game was played and perceived by fans. Competing with and against such heroes as Jerry West, Tom Heinsohn, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, and Elgin Baylor, and playing for the two greatest coaches of the era, Alex Hannum and the fiery Red Auerbach, Chamberlain and Russell propelled the NBA into the spotlight. But their off-court visibility and success\u2013to say nothing of their candor\u2013also inflamed passions along America\u2019s racial and generational fault lines. In many ways, Russell and Chamberlain helped make the NBA and, to some extent, America what they are today.Filled with dramatic conflicts and some of the great moments in sports history, and building to a thrilling climax\u2013the 1969 final series, the last showdown between Russell and Chamberlain\u2013The Rivalry has at its core a philosophical question: Can determination and a team ethos, embodied by the ultimate team player, Bill Russell, trump sheer talent, embodied by Wilt Chamberlain? Gripping, insightful, and utterly compelling, the story of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain is the stuff of sporting legend. Written with a reporter\u2019s unerring command of events and a storyteller\u2019s flair, The Rivalry will take its place as one of the classic works of sports history.From the Hardcover edition.",

Yet its modern reputation for excellence and service is only part of the legacy of Father Theodore Hesburgh, the university\u2019s president from 1952 to 1987. Father Ted\u2019s influence extended beyond Notre Dame\u2019s campus in Northern Indiana. He worked with presidents, Popes, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and his guidance resulted in nuclear nonproliferation, immigration reform, and civil rights legislation. One of the many Domers influenced by Father Ted was Richard \u201cDigger\u201d Phelps, Notre Dame\u2019s men\u2019s basketball coach from 1971 to 1991. Phelps gives readers a seat at the table with Father Ted, from the basketball locker room in the 1970s to Father Ted\u2019s final Mass before he passed away in 2015. This account is an intimate portrait of an unlikely friendship and a rare look at the private moments of a man Digger often describes as \u201ca living saint.\u201d",

    "description": "A wonderful fish-out-of water story about talented US athletes launching their AFL careers.  Talented basketballers Jason Holmes, Eric Wallace, Mason Cox and Matt Korcheck all had decent careers in Division One of the NCAA. But with the NBA out of reach, the dream they shared of becoming professional athletes seemed destined to go unfulfilled. Then came an invitation to a three-day scouting combine in Redondo Beach, California, to learn to play a sport they'd never even heard of before: Australian Rules football.  Fast-forward a couple of years and the four ambitious young athletes were signed to AFL clubs as international rookies, competing to play at the top level of the sport. Some have made it - including Holmes, who played his first senior matches for St Kilda in 2015 and Mason Cox who debuted for Collingwood in 2016 - while others will fail. But all are taking a great leap of faith - in their ability as athletes, and also in their adaptability and resilience.  A captivating book that crosses boundaries in more ways than one, Jumping at the Chance chronicles the AFL's efforts to draw foreign athletes to Aussie Rules, and tells the colourful stories of these and other young Americans prepared to dream big.  'Jumping at the Chance provides a great insight into what drives individuals to succeed ... a must-read for anyone aspiring to take a chance to fulfil their dreams in life and sport.' -Kevin Sheehan, National and International Talent Manager of the AFL  Gil Griffin lives in Playa Del Rey, California, and is a journalist and teacher of English and history.

    "description": "Clair Bee (1896-1983) was a hugely successful basketball coach at Rider College and Long Island University with a 412 and 87 record before his career was derailed in 1951 by a point-shaving scandal. In the trial that sent his star player, Sherman White, to prison, the judge excoriated Bee for creating a morally lax culture that contributed to his players' involvement with gambling. To a certain extent, Bee agreed with the judge's scolding, concluding that coaches, himself included, had become so driven to succeed on the court that they had lost sight of the educational role sports should play. His coaching career effectively over, Bee launched an effort to reform the ills he saw in college sports, and he did so in the pages of the Chip Hilton novels for young readers. He began the series in 1948, but it was the post-scandal books that he used as teaching tools. The books mirrored some of the events of the gambling scandal and were Bee's attempt to reform the problems plaguing college sports. He used his fiction to posit a better sports world that he hoped his young readers would construct and inhabit. The Chip Hilton books were extremely popular and have become a classic series, with over two million copies sold to date. Hoop Crazy is the fascinating story of Clair Bee and his star character Chip Hilton and the ways in which their lives, real and fictional, were intertwined.",

I personally have observed many of the ideas in this book, especially during Randy's career. In my years of high school and professional sports, I have not found a better blueprint for success than that which is presented in The Best-Laid Plans of a High School Basketball CEO.\" Dean Chance \u2022 1964 Cy Young Award Winning Pitcher \u2022 All-Ohio and State Champion Basketball Player \"I came to know Randy very well while recruiting one of his players. He runs as good a program as I have seen throughout the country. Randy and Matt Kramer have put together a great tool for design and example in how to lead a high school basketball program from top to bottom. The Best-Laid Plans comes to you with my highest recommendation. Brad Brownell \u2022 Head Men's Basketball Coach \u2022 Clemson University A leadership book, a book that offers tips on how to run a sports program from kindergarten through high school, an inspirational underdog story-The Best-Laid Plans of a High School Basketball CEO is all of the above and more. Here's a sample: Matt Kramer's boys' basketball team from Navarre Fairless High School was perhaps the worst in the Canton (Ohio) area, finishing 3-19 in 2004; in 2005, he was sitting on a coaching \"hot seat\" at 0-12 in the middle of January. His program and his career were left for dead... ...Twenty-six months later, Coach Kramer was standing on a ladder in the Canton Memorial Field House cutting down the nets after his Fairless team won the prestigious Canton Division-II District Championship Game in overtime and earned a spot in Ohio's Division-II \"Sweet-16\". Miracle? No, it happened with hard work, a little luck, and the mentoring of a legendary 500-win coach, Randy Montgomery-ideas that are now shared here in The Best-Laid Plans of a High School Basketball CEO. Matt Kramer Born the son of a basketball coach on July 16, 1969, Matt Kramer spent his childhood in a gym by Dan Kamer's side watching him run the program at Archbishop Hoban High School in Akron (Ohio). Kramer went on to play at Hoban, graduating in 1987, then went on to a two-year career as an NCAA Division-III collegiate basketball player at The College of Wooster for legendary coach Steve Moore. After transferring to Mount Union College in the fall of 1989, he incurred a back injury that ended his playing career and sent him down a career path in coaching and education. Married to his wife Christine since 1996 and father of three-sons Luke and Landon, and daughter Olivia-Matt Kramer shares ideas and stories here that range from being inspirational to heart-breaking, illustrating the roller-coaster ride a twenty-one-year career in coaching can be. Randy Montgomery A Hall-of-Fame high school basketball coach, and a disciple and close friend of West Virginia University head coach Bob Huggins, Randy Montgomery has spent over three decades using his innovative approach to lead two high school programs-Wooster Triway and North Canton Hoover-to elite status.",

    "description": "The greatest untold story in college basketball history &nbsp; Loyola University Chicago was ahead of its time when racial matters were forefront in a long overdue revolution in civil rights. The Ramblers of the 1962-1963 NCAA college basketball season were pioneers in race relations in sport, though most of the time they were simply playing the sport they loved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the NCAA tournament began in March, the Ramblers engaged in a series for the ages, daring to be the first NCAA Division I school to play five black athletes on the court at once and capturing the most prestigious title in college basketball at a time when states below the Mason-Dixon line still had laws on the books preventing black and white athletes from mixing even in pick-up games. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records were set, rivals faced, and one of the most famous and significant contests in college basketball playoff history played out in what incidentally became a model showcase for race relations. Nearly every time the Ramblers took the court, the game was unique in its magnitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relying significantly on exclusive interviews with surviving players, now in their seventies, Lew Freedman chronicles the entire journey, the adventure of the season that bound tight for a lifetime the group of men who lived through it.",

    "product_name": "Hardwood Glory: A Life of John Wooden (Youth Biography)",
    "description": "What you are as a person is far more important than what you are as a basketball player. John Wooden Foreword by UCLA Basketball Coach Steve Alford John Wooden helped define college basketball in the twentieth century and became an icon of American sports. His name is forever identified with the University of California, Los Angeles, where in the 1960s and 1970s he built a basketball dynasty and coached Bruin teams to unprecedented success: ten national championships in twelve years, seven national titles in a row, four perfect seasons, and an eighty-eight-game winning streak all NCAA men's records that remain unrivaled. To speak only of Wooden s UCLA coaching career is to overlook a significant part of his life story, however. Wooden was born in Indiana, and throughout his long life--he died in 2010 just months shy of his hundredth birthday--he remained proud of his Hoosier roots, enough so that he visited his home state whenever possible, maintained contacts with old friends, and always stayed true to the midwestern values instilled in him by his family and teachers. In 1948, when at age thirty-seven Wooden accepted UCLA s head basketball job, few West Coasters had ever heard of him. Plenty of Hoosiers had. They knew him as a young John Bob growing up on a Morgan County farm near the hamlet of Centerton, learning to toss a rag-stuffed ball through a tomato basket nailed to a barn wall. They knew him as the accomplished athlete nicknamed Pert who helped his Martinsville High School basketball team compete in three state championships. And they knew him as the India Rubber Man at Purdue University in West Lafayette, where, as a three-time All-American guard, he delighted fans with his hustle and dives for loose balls. Hoosiers, too, are the ones who called Wooden coach before the rest of the nation knew him as Coach. In the 1930s and 1940s, Johnny Wooden honed his hoops-teaching skills at South Bend Central High School and later at Indiana State Teachers College (now Indiana State University) in Terre Haute before crossing the continent to make basketball history. In this tenth volume of the Indiana Historical Society Press's celebrated Youth Biography Series, Barbara Olenyik Morrow traces the path of Wooden s career. Readers young and old alike will meet the coaches who served as Wooden s mentors; the high-school sweetheart who became his devoted wife, Nell; the players who both respected and challenged him; and the fans who revered him not just for his coaching record but also for his decency and common-sense wisdom wisdom encapsulated in his homespun maxims ( Never mistake activity for accomplishment ) and highlighted in his well-known Pyramid of Success. Full of archival photos, this biography also shows how Wooden s story is inseparable from major events and social currents in the twentieth century, from the Great Depression to civil-rights struggles to campus unrest during the Vietnam War.",

    "description": "It\u2019s hard to believe that there was a time when the jump shot didn\u2019t exist in basketball. When the sport was invented in 1891, players would take set shots with both feet firmly planted on the ground. Defenders controlled the sport, the pace was slower, and games would frequently end with scores fit for a football field. It took almost forty years before players began shooting jump shots of any kind and sixty-five years before it became a common sight. When the first jump shooting pioneers left the ground, they rose not only above their defenders, but also above the sport\u2019s conventions. The jump shot created a soaring offense, infectious excitement, loyal fans, and legends. Basketball would never be the same.Rise and Fire celebrates this crucial shot while tracing the history of how it revolutionized the game, shedding light on all corners of the basketball world, from NBA arenas to the playgrounds of New York City and the barns of Indiana. Award-winning journalist Shawn Fury obsesses over the jump shot, explores its fundamentals, puzzles over its complexities, marvels at its simplicity, and honors those who created some of basketball\u2019s greatest moments. Part history, part travelogue, and part memoir, Rise and Fire bounces from the dirt courts of the 1930s to today\u2019s NBA courts and state-of-the-art shooting labs, examining everything from how nets and rims affect a shooter to rivalries between shooting coaches to how the three-pointer came to rule the game. Impeccably researched and engaging, the book features interviews and profiles of legendary figures like Jerry West, Bob McAdoo, Ray Allen, and Denise Long---the first woman ever drafted by the NBA, plus dozens more, revealing the evolution of the shot over time.Analyzing the techniques and reliving some of the most unforgettable plays from the greats, Fury creates a technical, personal, historical, and even spiritual examination of the shot. This is not a dry how-to textbook of basketball mechanics; it is a lively tour of basketball history and a love letter to the sport and the shot that changed it forever.",

Despite bouncing paychecks, having to sleep on floors, and being stranded on road games, the players endured and thrived.&nbsp;Karra Porter brings to life the pioneers of the WBL: \u201cMachine Gun\u201d Molly Bolin, who set lasting scoring records\u2014then faced an historic custody battle because of her basketball career; Connie Kunzmann, a popular player whose murder rocked the league; Liz Silcott, whose remarkable talents masked deeper problems off the court; Ann Meyers, who went from an NBA tryout to the league she had rebuffed; Nancy Lieberman, whose flashy play and marketing savvy were unlike anything the women's game had ever seen.&nbsp;A story of hardship and sacrifice, but also of dedication and love for the game, Mad Seasons brings the WBL back to life and shows in colorful detail how this short-lived but pioneering league ignited the imagination of a new generation of female athletes and fans.",

Drawing heavily on oral history interviews, Grundy charts the many pleasures of athletics, from the simple joy of backyard basketball to the exhilaration of a state championship run. She also explores conflicts provoked by sports within the state--clashes over the growth of college athletics, the propriety of women's competition, and the connection between sports and racial integration, for example. Within this chronicle, familiar athletic narratives take on new meanings, moving beyond timeless stories of courage, fortitude, or failure to illuminate questions about race, manhood and womanhood, the purpose of education, the meaning of competition, and the structure of American society.",

A standout at Providence College, where he averaged 20.7 points and 17.9 rebounds per game, he was an All-American with the world at his fingertips. Although Barnes enjoyed two highly successful years in the American Basketball Association with the Spirits of St. Louis (winning Rookie of the Year honors and twice being named an All-Star), his career fizzled in the NBA as he wore out his welcome with the Detroit Pistons, Buffalo Braves, Boston Celtics, and San Diego Clippers in four years. His immaturity, as well as a chronic losing battle with drugs and alcohol, turned a potential superstar into a has-been by 1979. By then, his swagger was gone. So too was his game. Written by Mike Carey, who opened his house to Barnes later in his life, this is the story of a supremely gifted athlete whose self-destructive nature led to him living on the mean streets of East San Diego for three years as a panhandler and pimp. Eventually he would serve a total of five years in prison for various felony charges, including the sale of cocaine.Throughout his life, every time it appeared that \u201cBad News\u201d had turned the corner, his demons reappeared and succeeded in luring him back into becoming a conniving dope fiend. On September 8, 2014, Barnes finally hit rock bottom, passing away due to acute cocaine and heroin intoxication. He was sixty-two years old. With stories and quotes from Julius Erving, Bill Walton, Larry Brown, Mike D\u2019Antoni, and many others who crossed paths with Barnes, as well as a foreword from former Spirits announcer Bob Costas, \u201cBad News\u201d is the story of a squandered talent who could never defeat his inner demons.",

    "description": "Dominant. Few seasons in sports history better exemplify that term than the Golden State Warriors\u2019 road to the 2016-2017 NBA championship. After adding Kevin Durant to an already elite lineup, the Warriors stormed to a league-leading 67 wins in the regular season. Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Durant were all NBA All-Stars, and the foursome played an awe-inspiring brand of basketball. And the Warriors overcame adversity \u2014 from Durant missing 19 games late in the season due to injury to head coach Steve Kerr\u2019s health issues costing him much of the playoffs. Yet Curry, Durant and company avenged their 2016 NBA Finals loss with an unprecedented run through the postseason and a sublime NBA Finals destruction of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Packed with stunning photography and expert analysis from the Bay Area\u2019s largest newspaper publisher, Gold Standard takes fans through the Warriors\u2019 historic season, from Thompson\u2019s 60-point outburst to Durant\u2019s triumphant return to Oklahoma City to the final unforgettable minutes against the Cavaliers. This commemorative edition also includes in-depth profiles of Curry, Durant, Kerr, Thompson, Green and other Warriors stars.",

    "product_name": "Hoosier Honor: Bob Knight and Academic Success at Indiana University",
    "description": "College student-athletes are often a study of failure--a failure in graduation, in setting priorities, in having dreams fulfilled. Over 65 percent of all college athletes might not graduate. Only a handful of NCAA schools combine excellent basketball with a consistent level of graduation. One aim of this book is to help current college athletes to graduate by documenting a success story--Indiana University. The volume does not focus on Indiana's basketball success but instead its academic success under the seventeen-year tenure of Coach Knight. The author first details the failure of present sports programs in low graduation levels, abuse and exploitation of athletes, and in spirit and philosophy. He then explores what is described as Coach Knight's hard-love, and the people and processes involved in the Indiana program. This volume addresses athletic administrators, educators, athlete-students, and their fans.Written in a light and sensitive style, Hoosier Honor tells the success story of the Indiana University basketball team under Coach Bob Knight. The most winning coach in the Big Ten Conference, Knight's greatest success is his ability to graduate an extremely high percentage of his players. This volume documents that success: the success of a man who knows that defense wins games; a man with limitations who learned to compensate and trains his team to compensate; a teacher and a mentor. Voices of those around Coach Knight are finally heard and a psychological analysis of Knight and the Dostoyevsky-type double internal struggle is present in Knight's hard-love of the players. The IU program is a model one--philosophical approach to basketball.",

    "description": "Iowa six-player girls\u2019 basketball was the most successful sporting activity for girls in American history, at its zenith involving more than 70 percent of the girls in the state. The state tournament was so popular\u2014regularly drawing fifteen thousand fans, more than the boys\u2019 tourney\u2014that officials declined a lucrative broadcasting offer from ABC\u2019s Wide World of Sports rather than forfeit the Iowa Girls\u2019 High School Athletic Union\u2019s control of the game. The Only Dance in Iowa chronicles the one-hundred-year history of this Iowa tradition, long a symbol of the state\u2019s independence and the people\u2019s rural pride. Max McElwain shows how, well before the passage of Title IX in 1972, Iowa six-player girls\u2019 basketball was, as Sports Illustrated gushed, \u201ca utopia for girls\u2019 athletics.\u201d He also demonstrates how, ironically enough, the fallout from Title IX in many ways led to six-girl basketball\u2019s demise.&nbsp;Through interviews, careful ethnography, and detailed historical analysis, McElwain exposes the intricate political, sociological, and historical dynamics of this cultural phenomenon. His book reveals how six-girl basketball, flourishing with the passionate support of Iowa\u2019s small towns, school districts, and media, came to represent the state\u2019s strong traditional beliefs and the public school system\u2019s determination to maintain its identity in the face of national educational trends. The Only Dance in Iowa is as much a study of this disappearing culture as of the game it claimed as its own.",

Fans felt gut-punched in 2010 when local hero and MVP LeBron James announced he was leaving the Cavaliers and Northeast Ohio for Miami. The Cavs nose-dived in the standings and struggled to recover. Then, in June 2014, LeBron announced he was coming home. And he had a mission: Lead the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals and give Cleveland its first championship in 52 years. But would LeBron's return be enough to restore his reputation, revive the franchise, and reward the long-suffering fans? Veteran Cleveland sportswriter Terry Pluto tells how it all happened.  How LeBron won back fans with a heartfelt message \u2014 and savvy PR . . .

    "product_name": "Following the Ball: The Migration of African Soccer Players across the Portuguese Colonial Empire, 1949\u00961975 (Ohio RIS Global Series)",
    "description": "With Following the Ball, Todd Cleveland incorporates labor, sport, diasporic, and imperial history to examine the extraordinary experiences of African football players from Portugal\u2019s African colonies as they relocated to the metropole from 1949 until the conclusion of the colonial era in 1975. The backdrop was Portugal\u2019s increasingly embattled Estado Novo regime, and its attendant use of the players as propaganda to communicate the supposed unity of the metropole and the colonies.Cleveland zeroes in on the ways that players, such as the great Eus\u00e9bio, creatively exploited opportunities generated by shifts in the political and occupational landscapes in the waning decades of Portugal\u2019s empire. Drawing on interviews with the players themselves, he shows how they often assumed roles as social and cultural intermediaries and counters reductive histories that have depicted footballers as mere colonial pawns.To reconstruct these players\u2019 transnational histories, the narrative traces their lives from the informal soccer spaces in colonial Africa to the manicured pitches of Europe, while simultaneously focusing on their off-the-field challenges and successes. By examining this multi-continental space in a single analytical field, the book unearths structural and experiential consistencies and contrasts, and illuminates the components and processes of empire.",

    "description": "Critically acclaimed veteran sportswriter Frank Fitzpatrick takes readers courtside for one of the greatest upsets in college basketball history, the 1985 Villanova/Georgetown national championship showdown A veteran Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter and Pulitzer Prize finalist, Frank Fitzpatrick has long followed and covered Villanova basketball. In all that time, nothing compares with the Wildcats' legendary 1985 upset of Georgetown\u2015a win so spectacular and unusually flawless that days after its conclusion, sports columnists were already calling it \"The Perfect Game.\" The game, particularly its second half, was so different from what observers expected\u2015so different, in fact, from what anyone had ever seen that a shroud of myth almost immediately began to envelop it. Over the years, the game took on mythological proportions with heroes and villains, but with a darker, more complex subtext. In the midst of the sunny Reagan Administration, the game had been played out amid darker themes\u2015race, death, and, though no one knew it at the time, drugs.It was a night when the basketball world turned upside down. Villanova-Georgetown would be a perfect little microcosm of the 1980s. And it would be much more. Even now, a quarter-century later, the upset gives hope to sporting Davids everywhere. At the start of every NCAA Tournament, it is recalled as an exemplar of March's madness. Whenever sport's all-time upsets are ranked, it is high on those lists, along with hockey's Miracle on Ice. Now, through interviews with the players and coaches, through the work of sociologists and cultural critics, through the eyes of those who witnessed the game, Fitzpatrick brings to life the events of and surrounding that fateful night.",

Readers will meet players such as Blake Stepp, a blue chip high school recruit who selected Gonzaga because of what it wasn't ; Dan Dickau, who became a first-round NBA pick in 2002 after becoming Gonzaga's first All-American player in the history of the men's basketball program; &nbsp;Dan Monson, the former coach who instilled a fearless attitude among the players and began Gonzaga's storied run; Mark Few, the current coach who has continued and expanded upon the program's great success; and Father Tony Lehmann, the school's longtime chaplain who died in March 2002, who was the inspirational leader of the basketball team.

    "description": "Best and most \"extensive\" book available on all-time greats. This all-in-one Revised Edition book of basketball is a great statistical and factual reference with outstanding player analysis and descriptions on one's skill sets. Also included in the paperback, is a handy one-page \"chart\" (over 450 entries) of the greatest players of all-time individual scoring, rebounding, assists, steals and blocked shots titles, key second place finishes, awards and honors! This page alone makes the book a good reference. To begin (If you are a big-time basketball fan and like objective-facts and numbers, this resource is like a mini encyclopedia in the palm of your hands), you read the description and the first few pages on Amazon's preview (Look Inside!), make sure to click Surprise me! - to get a true glimpse of what this book is all about - better yet, click on Search Inside this book and punch in your favorite player! And that includes you too, Skip Bayless from ESPN's First Take. So far at the end of August, a panel of experts (so to speak) on the show have been giving their selections for Top 3 Greatest Players of All-Time soon after LeBron James publicly announced his. He chose, of course Michael Jordan, and then Dr. J &amp; Larry Bird - followed by Magic Johnson after he was asked to name a fourth. And then more recently, current and past players were giving their Mount Rushmore picks (Top 4) with assortment of mixed opinions. LeBron gave his in a more serious interview during the 2014 All-Star break when he then chose Jordan, Magic, Bird, and then Oscar Robertson! Hard to argue with those picks. Well, also, this is partly what this new 2013 release is all about, ranking the greatest players of all-time. LeBron himself would be amazed of what is written about him as a player. In addition, every chapter on every player has an awesome and unmatched description of his attributes an very own skill set! This book is a must have for all basketball fans. It contains hardcore facts and stats of The NBA's 50 Greatest Players of All-Time (rankings of Magic, Bird, Jordan, Wilt, Russell, Oscar, Dream and the rest of the greats of the game- find out who's in the top 10?) with exclusive projected rankings of seven current players? As they approach their primes and where they might end up in the Elite Rankings of All-Time! On the cover of the book and on its first page title, instead of changing the subtitle from projected pick six?, to a projected super seven! I have decided to keep both subtitles. Within the 57 chapter player rankings, there is also an additional 50 plus players written about exclusively and extensively including Kevin Love in Blake Griffin\u2019s chapter as potentially becoming the greatest power forward of the current era. In the player comparisons throughout, it distinguishes which players are better than others from an objective point of view- which in turn allows you to judge for yourselves! For example: Is Wilt Chamberlain better than Bill Russell or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Is Magic Johnson better than Larry Bird? Is Kobe Bryant better than Jerry West? Is Tim Duncan better than Karl Malone? Is John Stockton better than Isiah Thomas? Also listed is an All-Time NBA First Team, Second Team, and Third Team based on projected rankings. The book is filled with player introductions including a mini-biography, player opinions from past and current great players, player attributes and skill sets, records and individual accolades, award and honors, player rankings and player comparisons throughout, and a player\u2019s chronological history year by year with interceding player evaluations of the NBA\u2019s elite and players outside the top 50. The book was completed at near 200,000 words. And finally the most interesting part of this book, is that I have created a one-of-a-kind chart (as mentioned above) for individual accolades, honors and awards of the 50 greatest basketball players of all-time!",

    "product_name": "Al Mcguire: The Colorful Warrior",
    "description": "Al McGuire was not only one of the most successful coaches in college basketball history, but arguably, as this insightful memoir shows, the most colorful and unpredictable as well. During his 13 years at Marquette, the fiery coach guided his team to more than 20 victories 11 times, earning them 11 straight postseason bids. In 1970, angered that the NCAA wanted to send his 26-3 Warriors to another region, McGuire instead took his team to New York\u0092s Madison Square Garden and won the National Invitation Tournament. Seven years later, after announcing his retirement, the outspoken Irishman beat the odds and went out on top when Marquette defeated North Carolina to garner the school\u0092s first and only NCAA championship. From 1977 until shortly before his death in January 2001, McGuire remained in the national spotlight as a successful TV commentator for NBC, CBS, and ESPN. A recipient of numerous \"Coach of the Year\" awards during his career, McGuire was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. On the court, McGuire was not just a coach, but also a fighter who would do anything he felt necessary to gain an edge. His scrappy, dance-hall teams were a reflection of his street-smart Irish personality. His screaming tirades and zany stunts were all part of the show. Off the court, however, McGuire was a totally different person. What few fans saw was the \"other\" Al McGuire, the philosopher behind the showman who spoke softly of the deepest issues of life. Like all great men, he had singular demons that haunted him, not just about his coaching career, but also about his place in God\u0092s whole scheme of things. McGuire\u0092s superior coaching skills and announcing talents made him unique, but so did his quick wit, remarkable intellect, and multifaceted personality. Over the years his entertaining and often controversial remarks and his altercations with fellow coaches, referees, and even the NCAA became legendary. Blessed with the gift of gab, he possessed a marvelous wit and an insightful mind. Depending on his mood or situation, he could be warm and friendly or cold and distant. In one moment of reflection he summed up in a sentence what he felt life was all about: \"We reach for the stars as we rush towards our graves.\"",

    "description": "Few cities can claim a hardwood heritage like that found in metro Detroit. Metro Detroit has been the epicenter for cataclysmic change in the past 60 years that no other major American city has suffered, but the one constant among so much upheaval is a passionate following afforded high school basketball. The rise and fall of the automotive industry, the Motown record label's emergence and eventual relocation, social and racial unrest, and the polarization of one of America's great cities has not slowed the love and passion Detroiters-city and suburban dwellers alike-share for prep basketball.",

    "product_name": "Al Mcguire: The Colorful Warrior",
    "description": "Al McGuire was not only one of the most successful coaches in college basketball history, but arguably, as this insightful memoir shows, the most colorful and unpredictable as well. During his 13 years at Marquette, the fiery coach guided his team to more than 20 victories 11 times, earning them 11 straight postseason bids. In 1970, angered that the NCAA wanted to send his 26-3 Warriors to another region, McGuire instead took his team to New York\u0092s Madison Square Garden and won the National Invitation Tournament. Seven years later, after announcing his retirement, the outspoken Irishman beat the odds and went out on top when Marquette defeated North Carolina to garner the school\u0092s first and only NCAA championship. From 1977 until shortly before his death in January 2001, McGuire remained in the national spotlight as a successful TV commentator for NBC, CBS, and ESPN. A recipient of numerous \"Coach of the Year\" awards during his career, McGuire was inducted into the National Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. On the court, McGuire was not just a coach, but also a fighter who would do anything he felt necessary to gain an edge. His scrappy, dance-hall teams were a reflection of his street-smart Irish personality. His screaming tirades and zany stunts were all part of the show. Off the court, however, McGuire was a totally different person. What few fans saw was the \"other\" Al McGuire, the philosopher behind the showman who spoke softly of the deepest issues of life. Like all great men, he had singular demons that haunted him, not just about his coaching career, but also about his place in God\u0092s whole scheme of things. McGuire\u0092s superior coaching skills and announcing talents made him unique, but so did his quick wit, remarkable intellect, and multifaceted personality. Over the years his entertaining and often controversial remarks and his altercations with fellow coaches, referees, and even the NCAA became legendary. Blessed with the gift of gab, he possessed a marvelous wit and an insightful mind. Depending on his mood or situation, he could be warm and friendly or cold and distant. In one moment of reflection he summed up in a sentence what he felt life was all about: \"We reach for the stars as we rush towards our graves.\"",

    "description": "In 1939, a team of short, scrappy kids from a vocational school established specifically for Mexican Americans became the high school basketball champions of San Antonio, Texas. Their win, and the ensuing riot it caused, took place against a backdrop of shifting and conflicted attitudes toward Mexican Americans and American nationalism in the WWII era. \u201cOnly when the Mexicans went from perennial runners-up to champs,\u201d Garc\u00eda writes, \u201cdid the emotions boil over.\u201d The first sports book to look at Mexican American basketball specifically, When Mexicans Could Play Ball is also a revealing study of racism and cultural identity formation in Texas. Using personal interviews, newspaper articles, and game statistics to create a compelling narrative, as well as drawing on his experience as a sports writer, Garc\u00eda takes us into the world of San Antonio\u2019s Sidney Lanier High School basketball team, the Voks, which became a two-time state championship team under head coach William Carson \u201cNemo\u201d Herrera. An alumnus of the school himself, Garc\u00eda investigates the school administrators\u2019 project to Americanize the students, Herrera\u2019s skillful coaching, and the team\u2019s rise to victory despite discrimination and violence from other teams and the world outside of the school. Ultimately, Garc\u00eda argues, through their participation and success in basketball at Lanier, the Voks players not only learned how to be American but also taught their white counterparts to question long-held assumptions about Mexican Americans.",

    "description": " Deep in the heart of tobacco country, the Tar Heel State brings out the best of college basketball: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, and Dean Smith; Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, and Mike Krzyzewski; Billy Packer, Tim Duncan, and Bones McKinney; David Thompson, Lorenzo Charles, and Jim Valvano. What these men have in common -- besides being legends in the world of college hoops -- is that they are all part of Big Four basketball in the state of North Carolina. For the last fifty years the Big Four -- North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, and North Carolina State -- have defined greatness on the hardwood courts.  Nowhere else in America are there four schools with such rich basketball history and tradition located so close to one another. The four grew up within a thirty -- four -- mile radius of one another, and to this day, North Carolina, N.C. State, and Duke are only a half hour's drive apart. (Wake Forest, which had been located nineteen miles west of Duke University and sixteen miles north of North Carolina State, received a hefty gift from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1956 to move to Winston -- Salem, 110 miles due west.) In Four Corners, Winston-Salem Journal sportswriter Joe Menzer chronicles the storied histories, timeless traditions, and fierce rivalries that have placed these four basketball -- crazed schools among the best college programs in the nation.  In North Carolina, college basketball is not a matter of life and death; it's much more important than that. It isn't just that these teams are near one another geographically or that they're very good every year. It's the way the fans embrace their team and hate the other three schools that makes the rivalries so dynamic. Newcomers to the region find themselves forced to choose from among the four. You're either a Wolfpack fan, a Blue Devils fan, a Demon Deacons fan, or a Tar Heels fan -- and if you're not a Tar Heels fan, then you're an automatic member of one of the largest organizations in the state no matter what team you root for: the ABC gang -- Anybody But Carolina.  Menzer traces the history of the greatest concentration of talent, success, and venom in all of college sports, He tells the stories of how these four schools established themselves in an era dominated by big-city schools from New York or California, of the ebb and flow of success that each of these schools has experienced throughout the years, of the point-shaving scandals and recruiting violations that periodically rocked the rivalries between the schools, of the numerous ACC and national championships these teams have won, and of the unforgettable personalities who led the programs and dominated the sport.  From the early days of N.C. State's Everett Case and Wake Forest's Bones McKinney to the retirement of North Carolina's Dean Smith, from North Carolina's triple-overtime victory over Wilt Chamberlain's Kansas team in the 1957 NCAA Finals to Christian Laettner's miraculous buzzer beater against Kentucky in the 1992 Eastern Regional final, Menzer presents the sprawling story of the Big Four in an exciting and dramatic fashion. The first book to chronicle the entire history of life in that area of hoops heaven known as Tobacco Road, Four Corners brings back all the memories that have made basketball in the Tar Heel State the force it is today.",

In between there were legends such as the incomparable Dave Bing, Roosevelt Bouie, and Louis Orr, who together formed the Louie and Bouie Show, along with names like Derrick Coleman, Sherman Douglas, Lawrence Moten, and John Wallace. Legends of Syracuse Basketball, now newly revised, features twenty-four players, one coach, and one special team. Of the players mentioned, seventeen played in the NBA. Within the book\u2019s pages are stories straight from the legends\u2019 teammates, their coaches, and the legends themselves.",

    "description": "LAPCHICK encapsulates Joe Lapchick\u2019s fifty-year career that mirrors the framework of basketball in America. Coach Lapchick, twice enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame, experienced a life in basketball that places him with a handful of the pioneers of the game. The book uses Joe Lapchick as a lens through which the rise and development of basketball is clearly understood. Lapchick began a professional career that led him in the 1920s to the famous Original Celtics where he became the game\u2019s most successful big man. After a successful professional career, he turned to coaching where he spent more than twenty years coaching at St. John\u2019s University [1936-1947, 1956-1965] only separated by nine years with the New York Knickerbockers. His record was among the nation\u2019s best, both as a collegiate and professional coach, winning four NITs. During his second stint at St. John\u2019s, Gus had the pleasure of playing for Coach Lapchick. The experience was so riveting that he later was motivated to write his coach\u2019s biography. Alfieri conducted more than 250 interviews, including ones with Lou Carnesecca, Wilt Chamberlain, Bobby Knight, and John Wooden.",

    "description": "The best basketball players and coaches are known not only for their success in the sport but for the manner in which they manifest their knowledge and abilities in playing, coaching, and teaching the game.  Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Steve Nash, Diana Taurasi, and other great players past and present share a special grasp of what is needed in every situation on the court and how to maximize their own effectiveness as well as that of their team. Teams coached by John Wooden, Phil Jackson, Pat Summitt, and Mike Krzyzewski won many championships because of their coaches' amazing ability to teach, motivate, discipline, and unite players to perform to their potential individually and as a group. Court Sense highlights all those qualities that make players and teams great, and it provides practical ways to improve any intangibles that might be lacking. The first half of the book covers all the basics a player must have in place, on and off the court, in order to excel. The second half features the six Cs that are crucial to on-court performance: coachability, communication, cohesion, capacity to lead, competitiveness, and concentration. Author John Giannini brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the subject as a former collegiate player and veteran coach who has earned a PhD in sport psychology. His insights and advice are combined with real-life examples and supported by stories shared by these top coaches: John Beilein, Tony Bennett, Tom Crean, Jamie Dixon, Steve Donahue, Joanne P. McCallie, Sean Miller, Oliver Purnell, Bo Ryan, Tubby Smith, Sharon Versyp, and Jay Wright.  Playing like a winner first requires preparing like one. Use Court Sense to your advantage and you'll be one step closer to cutting down the nets.",

    "description": "The key to success for any basketball team is defense, and the heart of most successful defensive systems is half-court man-to-man defense. Winning Defense is the ultimate book on this crucial aspect of the game. Much more than a basic primer, this advanced guide explores the intricacies of transition and half-court defense that give winning teams their edge. It's all here: trapping, switching, cutters, screeners, post defense, and defending two- and three-man exercises. Out-of-bound and end-of-game situations. Drills to enhance individual and team technique. A section on rebounding, the finishing touch to any successful defensive effort, and a unique approach to transition defense. Since it's publication in 1993, Winning Defense has become the bible of half-court man-to-man defense for serious and successful coaches and players everywhere! Del Harris is one of basketball's most respected, honored, and experienced teachers. He began his career as an elementary coach in Johnson City, Tennessee, and progressed through the high school, college, international, and professional ranks--enjoying great success at each stop. Harris took the NBA's Houston Rockets, who had finished the regular season with a winning percentage below .500 to the finals of the NBA playoffs in 1981 in one of the great Cinderella stories in league history. He also led the Milwaukee Bucks to the playoffs in each of his four seasons as head coach. As the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, he nearly duplicated his 1981 miracle season in 1995, leading a team expected to go nowhere to the playoffs, where they lost in a thrilling six-game Western Conference semifinal series to San Antonio. As a result, he was named 1994-95 NBA Coach of the Year. A noted speaker and clinician, Harris has written two previous basketball books and a sports novel for young readers. His is a member of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.",

Together with rookie coach Tyronn Lue, those Cavs put together an astounding run to the title.Sports Illustrated has been there from the start of the creation of this roster, breaking the news of James' return and following the team's progress over two years and now celebrates Cleveland's pride with a special commemorative edition collecting the best of SI's Cavs\u2019 coverage through the years.

    "description": "For three decades, Al McGuire was the heart and soul of college basketball, first as the street-smart head coach at Marquette University and later as the hoops-savvy television analyst whose unique mix of humor, candor, and uncanny insights brought a whole new dimension to sports broadcasting. McGuire was the consummate professional at whatever he did. Possessing an impeccable insider's knowledge of the game, he was able to communicate to viewers in ways that were as entertaining as they were informative. He made people laugh, he could laugh at himself, and his joy for the game and people in it made him one of sports' most enduring icons.McGuire passed away at the age of seventy-two in early 2001 after a long illness, leaving behind a basketball-rich legacy that had its poetic qualities as well. Never was that more evident than in the 1976-77 season, when McGuire announced to his team in midseason that it would be his last year in coaching. The season ended with McGuire overcome by emotion, sitting on the Marquette bench with tears streaming down his face as the Warriors gave their beloved coach the ultimate going-away present, a national championship. Thus ended a twenty-year coaching career in which McGuire completed a 405-143 record, including a 295-80 mark at Marquette.In I Remember Al McGuire, the legendary basketball coach and announcer is remembered by dozens of associates, who offer their favorite anecdotes, insights, assessments, and other assorted memories of a basketball junkie as quick with a quip as he was with a word of encouragement. Among those contributing to this book are his former players and assistant coaches as well as other head coaches, media personalities, friends, and associates who knew him well at one time or another in his life",

    "description": "In an age dominated by overhyped athletes who are sometimes short on character, JoJo White's story offers a refreshing look back at one athlete's career-a career that was the product of genuine good values. In Make It Count, author Mark C. Bodanza presents a biography of a man who triumphed both on and off the basketball court. White's story is interwoven with ours as a nation. His basketball days were shaped by-and in a few cases, helped shape-events of monumental importance. Race relations, the war in Vietnam, and political tumult across the land punctuated White's years as both a Kansas Jayhawk and Boston Celtic. Bodanza shows how, through his years on the court, the point guard from St. Louis, Missouri, maintained a steady contribution to the game that became his passion while still a child. With each passing game, season, or team that formed a part of his playing days, White stayed true to principles learned before he donned his first high-school uniform. Make It Count narrates a compelling chronicle of a sports career complete with drama, triumphs, and losses, as well as an affirmation that hard work has its reward. In life, as in basketball, JoJo White's approach to each opportunity that a new day presents has always been the same: make it count.",
