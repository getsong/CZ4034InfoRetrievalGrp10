The aim of this project is to perform the various tasks in the different stages of information retrieval and adopt different methods to enhance and optimise each stage. The stages include Crawling, Indexing and Querying and Classification. In this report, our group has selected Amazon Books as the target website for crawling, and use the crawled information for further processing.
