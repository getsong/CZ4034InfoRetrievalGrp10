These days we're bombarded with so many messages about what to eat more of and what to eat less of and what to give up altogether, it can all get a little confusing and, let's face it, overwhelming. When there are so many passing fads and extreme diets out there, it's a relief to turn to a voice of reason, Australia's bestselling and most trusted cook, Donna Hay, for a realistic, sustainable and more balanced approach to fresher, healthier eating. Donna says: 'If there's one thing I've learned about myself, it's that I'm happiest when life is balanced. It rings true in all areas- work and play, friends and family, and, for me especially, food. Diets have never been my thing, I don't like the idea of anyone being on one! But I do love the way food can make me feel, uplifting me with energy, nourishing me with cosy goodness, or treating me with a little sweetness. LIFE IN BALANCE is about embracing food and all its benefits. Each chapter, from breakfast to baking, has simple recipes enriched with nature's superfoods - think leafy greens, bright fresh berries, creamy nuts and nourishing grains. Plus, I've profiled all my power pantry staples for you, like chia seeds, coconut sugar and raw cacao. Let this book help you find your own perfect balance, while enjoying every bite.' In a gorgeous new user-friendly square paperback format, featuring tactile paper stock and stunning photography, Donna packs in a wealth of ideas and information that you can trust, and flavours and tastes that will inspire you. From new ideas for power dinners to tempting grills, from super-charged breakfasts to low-carb options, LIFE IN BALANCE is full of super-satisfying recipes - nourishing, virtuous and delicious. And because we all need the occasional treat, there's also a few yummy better-for-you sweets. The only kind of diet that works, after all, is the balanced diet - the one you can sustain long term. And when your life is in balance, you feel great and it shows - from the inside out.",

Just as Alice Waters changed the way Americans thought about food, Takashi Sugimoto has revolutionized the act of dining in Japan.Shunju: New Japanese Cuisine brings you the experience of dining at Tokyo's most innovative and exciting restaurants: Shunju. Everything about these restaurants is unique\u2014their design, decoration, and lighting\u2014but most especially the cuisine. At the Shunju restaurants the menu changes with the seasons and the specials change daily depending on what is available from the market. The chefs choose from hand-picked farmed and wild vegetables that arrive each morning. The food, though quintessentially Japanese, is fresh and innovative, with unexpected touches from other cuisines.The restaurants' designs are modern, funky, and often quite bizarre. Sugimoto, the famed interior designer, has incorporated such unusual installations as original sidewalk gratings from the London subway and hand plastered mud walls. In this way, the designs represent the new lifestyle philosophy of Japan's urban, cultivated youth: that within the chaotic city of modern design and Japanese food, more value should be placed on nature and time, on the textures of genuine materials, the flavors of natural foods.Stunning photographs, shot on location throughout the four seasons, and modern Japanese recipes that are as beautiful in presentation as they are to taste, make Shunju: New Japanese Cuisine a must for both professional chefs and dedicated amateurs.Sections include:The Seasonal KitchenSpring foodsSummer foodsAutumn foodsWinter foods",

Like the new generation of beer drinkers who consciously seek out distinctive craft-brewed beers, many people find that their palates have been reawakened and re-educated by the taste of locally baked, whole-grain breads. Today's village bakers are finding an important new role--linking tradition with a sophisticated new understanding of natural levens, baking science and oven construction. Daniel Wing, a lover of all things artisinal, had long enjoyed baking his own sourdough bread. His quest for the perfect loaf began with serious study of the history and chemistry of bread baking, and eventually led to an apprenticeship with Alan Scott, the most influential builder of masonry ovens in America. Alan and Daniel have teamed up to write this thoughtful, entertaining, and authoritative book that shows you how to bake superb healthful bread and build your own masonry oven. The authors profile more than a dozen small-scale bakers around the U.S. whose practices embody the holistic principles of community-oriented baking based on whole grains and natural leavens. The Bread Builders will appeal to a broad range of readers, including:  Connoisseurs of good bread and good food. Home bakers interested in taking their bread and pizza to the next level of excellence. Passionate bakers who fantasize about making a living by starting their own small bakery. Do-it-yourselfers looking for the next small construction project.

Why spend time sorting through the millions of cookie recipes available in books, magazines, and on the Internet? Isn\u2019t it easier just to remember 1-2-3? That\u2019s the ratio of ingredients that always make a basic, delicious cookie dough: 1 part sugar, 2 parts fat, and 3 parts flour. From there, add anything you want\u2014chocolate, lemon and orange zest, nuts, poppy seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, almond extract, or peanut butter, to name a few favorite additions. Replace white sugar with brown for a darker, chewier cookie. Add baking powder and/or eggs for a lighter, airier texture. Ratios are the starting point from which a thousand variations begin. Ratios are the simple proportions of one ingredient to another. Biscuit dough is 3:1:2\u2014or 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, and 2 parts liquid. This ratio is the beginning of many variations, and because the biscuit takes sweet and savory flavors with equal grace, you can top it with whipped cream and strawberries or sausage gravy. Vinaigrette is 3:1, or 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, and is one of the most useful sauces imaginable, giving everything from grilled meats and fish to steamed vegetables or lettuces intense flavor. Cooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free. With thirty-three ratios and suggestions for enticing variations, Ratio is the truth of cooking: basic preparations that teach us how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchen\u2014water, flour, butter and oils, milk and cream, and eggs\u2014work. Change the ratio and bread dough becomes pasta dough, cakes become muffins become popovers become crepes.

        "description": "In 2015 Pierre Gagnaire, whose 11 restaurants worldwide boast two and three Michelin stars, was voted \u2018Best Chef in the World\u2019 by his peers and 2016 sees him mark 50 dazzlingly creative and successful years in the kitchen. To celebrate this outstanding career Grub Street is delighted to be publishing his new title La Cuisine des 5 Saisons in English. This beautiful book is about his recipes and his work as a chef and for the first time makes his dishes accessible for home cooks. Why is it called Five Seasons? Five seasons because for chef Gagnaire there are five not four seasons; Spring, he says must be divided into two seasons because you don't have the same produce in March and in June. Thus the recipes in this book follow the rhythm of the seasons and their bounty. In each chapter there are six menus with starter, main dish and dessert. The recipes come from Pierre Gagnaire's culinary repertory and these are the recipes which made him famous. Through the recipes one can see the strong worldwide influence in Pierre Gagnaire's cuisine, cooking with every kind of ingredient. His eponymous restaurant at 6 rue Balzac in Paris (in the 8th arrondissement) specializes in modern French cuisine, and has garnered three Michelin stars.

In&nbsp;Pressure Cooker Perfection,&nbsp;the first volume in our new test kitchen handbook series, the editors at America's Test Kitchen demystify an appliance that to many home cooks remains intimidating -- but shouldn't. Modern pressure cookers are safer, quieter, more reliable, and more user-friendly than old-fashioned jiggle-top models. And they can prepare a wide range of foods -- everything from barbecue to risotto -- in record time. Cooking under pressure results in better-tasting dishes because every drop of flavor is trapped in the sealed pot. This fact, combined with the shorter cooking time, means that your dishes will be supercharged with flavor. And cooking under pressure is versatile. While they're ideal for roasts and stews, pressure cookers can also turn out perfectly tender beans, grains, and legumes in short order. If ever there was a cooking method that could benefit from the obsessive trial and error that our test kitchen is known for, this is it. When cooking time is compressed, every minute matters, and when flavors are amplified, even a small change becomes significant. We ran hundreds of tests in fifteen pressure cookers to find out what works and what doesn't, and we deliver the foolproof, guaranteed-successful recipes in&nbsp;Pressure Cooker Perfection.&nbsp;With this foolproof guide to cooking under pressure, every home cook will be guaranteed success.",

If you suffer from the pain and discomfort of a digestive condition such as IBS, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, or nonresponsive celiac disease, it just might change yours.The Complete Low-FODMAP Diet (cowritten by Sue Shepherd) introduced this revolutionary treatment, which is rapidly becoming the first-line recommendation by doctors and dietitians worldwide.

More than three quarters of adults with IBS who reduce their intake of these foods gain relief. Now, this follow-up cookbook brings you 150 simple, delicious, and brand-new recipes that are full of flavor but low in FODMAPs. The mix includes:breakfasts to start the day off right (Blueberry Pancakes; Banana-Chocolate Chip Muffins)starters and sides for every occasion (Spring Rolls; Chicken, Bacon, and Pesto Mini Pizzas; Stuffed Roasted Bell Peppers)soups and salads full of flavor (Vietnamese Beef Noodle Salad; Creamy Seafood Soup)entr\u00e9es that make you feel good (Chicken and Vegetable Curry; Speedy Spaghetti Bolognese; Beef Satay Stir-Fry with Peanut Sauce)desserts that satisfy (Flourless Chocolate Cake; Almond Cookies; Baked Blueberry Cheesecakes).The low-FODMAP diet puts an end to suffering in silence, fearing the possible consequences of every meal, or confining yourself to a handful of bland, \u201csafe\u201d foods. The only thing missing from this comprehensive collection is the FODMAPs\u2014and you\u2019d never know it!",

More than thirty-four of the fifty United States, plus many Canadian regions, have cities and towns at altitudes of more than 2,500 feet, yet there are hardly any cookbooks that address the special needs of these local bakers. Until now. Award-winning cookbook author Susan G. Purdy has finally written the first-ever foolproof guide to high-altitude baking.Purdy has actually \"gone there and done that,\" staying as long as it took to bake these recipes to perfection at five different locations -- and elevations -- across thecountry. In Pie in the Sky, Purdy leaves behind old conversion tables, disproves many oft-repeated calculations and adjustments, and presents reliable recipes in their entirety for each altitude. She takes out the tinkering and guarantees success at any height.In addition, she explains the hows and whys, gives tips and hints for problems specific to every altitude, and generally demystifies the subject of atmospheric obstacles that cause favorite recipes to flop. Whether they live in the eastern mountains or the far west, in Boston, Massachusetts; Boone, North Carolina; or Santa Fe, New Mexico; home bakers as well as experienced chefs will love the wide range of easy-to-make treats including Mile-High Lemon Meringue Pie, Coconut Cake with Coconut Icing, Paradise Peak Chocolate Souffl\u00e9, Vail Lemon-Poppy Seed Loaf, Celestial Challah, and Sour Cream Streusel Coffee Cake.Every recipe was tested at sea level (Connecticut), 3,000 feet (North Carolina and Virginia), 5,000 feet (Idaho and Colorado), 7,000 feet (New Mexico), and 10,000 feet (Colorado) and can be used at these elevations or any points in between.",

        "description": "Meat eating is often a contentious subject, whether considering the technical, ethical, environmental, political, or health-related aspects of production and consumption. This book is a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination and critique of meat consumption by humans, throughout their evolution and around the world. Setting the scene with a chapter on meat\u2019s role in human evolution and its growing influence during the development of agricultural practices, the book goes on to examine modern production systems, their efficiencies, outputs, and impacts. The major global trends of meat consumption are described in order to find out what part its consumption plays in changing modern diets in countries around the world. The heart of the book addresses the consequences of the \"massive carnivory\" of western diets, looking at the inefficiencies of production and at the huge impacts on land, water, and the atmosphere. Health impacts are also covered, both positive and negative. In conclusion, the author looks forward at his vision of \u201crational meat eating\u201d, where environmental and health impacts are reduced, animals are treated more humanely, and alternative sources of protein make a higher contribution. Should We Eat Meat? is not an ideological tract for or against carnivorousness but rather a careful evaluation of meat's roles in human diets and the environmental and health consequences of its production and consumption. It will be of interest to a wide readership including professionals and academics in food and agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental science, and regulatory and policy making bodies around the world.",

        "description": "In the 1970s and \u201980s, the brewing industry shifted was from large corporate suppliers to smaller, independent \u201cmicrobrewers,\u201d typified by producers such as the Boston Beer Company and Sierra Nevada Brewing Company. Today, the market is going even smaller\u2014with tiny, independent brewers setting up shop in neighborhood brew houses nationwide, focusing on crafting unique, flavorful brews specifically for their extremely local clientele. The reality is that beer is in the midst of a renaissance in this country, driven by a new class of these dedicated craft \u201cnanobrewers\u201d and growing communities of drinkers looking for something more from their daily brew\u2014something higher-quality, more unique, more local. These microbrewers rent out small spaces or buy industrial equipment to install in their garages. They\u2019re accountants, middle-school teachers, and plumbers who are passionate about beer and who dedicate their free time to producing three or so barrels of their own brew at a time. They sell their bottles to close friends and gift it to family members for birthdays and holidays. They enjoy what they do and they\u2019re proud of their product. What\u2019s it like inside these small-time brewing operations? What happens behind the scenes? What goes into making high-end craft beer on a small scale? True Beer takes an on-the-ground look at the ultra-small side of the craft brewing movement from the inside out by profiling a number of independent American breweries in detail and using that as a jumping-off point to examine the art and science of brewing, the local farmers and providers behind the scenes, the market itself as well as national trends in nanobrewing, and modern craft beer production.",

When eating a raw diet, nuts, sprouts, seeds, sprouted grains and leafy greens are examples of foods that are especially protein-rich.

        "description": "Chef Chloe Coscarelli has revolutionized how vegans cook and eat with exciting, plant-based recipes that are fun, full of flavor, and make you feel healthier. When she decided to become a vegan chef, she dreamed of changing the way the world ate. This was in the \u201cpre-kale\u201d days, when veggie burgers were frozen, tasteless patties loathed by the general public and if a vegan wanted to eat, well, then she had to cook! Today, corner stores stock their shelves with almond milk and mainstream restaurants pepper their menus with quinoa, tempeh, chia seeds, faro, ramps, and so many variations of avocado toast. There is truly no better time to love to eat than now\u2014and no easier time to be a vegan.&nbsp;Chloe believes the most delicious dishes come from plant-based ingredients, and has debunked the myth that vegan cooking is bland and visually unenticing. Enter: CHLOE FLAVOR. Every recipe here is bold in taste, loud in color, unabashedly unique, and, above all, easy to make. With dishes like Smoky Grits &amp; Greens, Mango-Guacamole Crunch Burgers, and Sea Salted Chocolate Chunk Cookies, this food is for fun, friends, and family\u2014and it\u2019s all about the flavor. Vegans will delight in Chloe\u2019s creations and carnivores won\u2019t miss the meat one bit.  First breaking onto the culinary scene as the only vegan chef to capture the top prize on Food Network\u2019s Cupcake Wars, Chef Chloe Coscarelli has since been recognized for bringing vegan cuisine to the mainstream as an award-winning chef, successful entrepreneur, and bestselling cookbook author. She has published three bestselling cookbooks, and in 2015 she opened her first restaurant, by CHLOE., bringing healthy and satisfying vegan and plant-based dishes to the masses. She lives in New York City.",

Reata: Legendary Texas Cuisine tells the tale of one American family that, against the breathtaking backdrop of Texas, took risks, worked hard, and dreamed big. &nbsp;Today the pride of the Micallef family are its two Reata restaurants, the original location in the tiny West Texas town of Alpine, and its much larger sibling in Fort Worth. Reata pays homage to America\u2019s cowboys and the values they have come to symbolize by promoting the traditional ideals of integrity, generosity, and hospitality with an easy ambience, exciting dishes, and exceptional service.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reata menus combine familiar Texas fare with fresh culinary trends, including signature favorites, like the pepper-crusted tenderloin, the golden chicken-fried steaks, and the tenderloin tamales. Adventurous cooks will want to try the buffalo rib eye and the smoked quail, as well as some of the more surprising pairings, such as the boar ribs with a Thai-inspired spicy peanut dipping sauce. And no Reata cookbook would be complete without the fiery jalape\u00f1o cheese grits or the unrivaled \u201cGiant\u201d onion rings.&nbsp;So if you can\u2019t drop by one of the restaurants and set a spell, Reata: Legendary Texas Cuisine will give you a taste of Reata that\u2019s as big and bold as the state of Texas itself.",

One-dish meals are perennially popular on American tables, and books devoted to one-dish cooking perform well. Robin Robertson's One-Dish Vegan is the first book at the intersection of these two powerful cookbook categories. Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of very successful titles in the vegetarian category. She is known for her creativity in the kitchen, for the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works, and for her expertise in vegetarian nutrition - with a special focus lately on how vegans still can get enough protein in their diets. Typically, it takes two or three courses or dishes to make a well-rounded vegan meal. To meet this criterion in one dish takes the kind of ingenuity and expert knowledge that Robertson possesses. One-Dish Vegan contains more than 150 recipes. They range from the most popular categories of one-dish dining like stews, chilis, and casseroles (and other baked dishes) to a host of stovetop saut\u00c3\u00a9s and stir-fries as well as substantial salads and dishes that feature pasta as well as other noodles, such as Asian noodles. The recipes are at once homey and adventuresome, comforting and surprising. Above all, they demonstrate that it really is possible to get a complete vegan meal into one dish, full of good-for-you nutrients and bright, satisfying flavors.",

A deeply personal and gracious restaurant, in both menu and philosophy, Prune uses the elements of home cooking and elevates them in unexpected ways. The result is delicious food that satisfies on many levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;Highly original in concept, execution, look, and feel, the Prune cookbook is an inspired replica of the restaurant\u2019s kitchen binders. It is written to Gabrielle\u2019s cooks in her distinctive voice, with as much instruction, encouragement, information, and scolding as you would find if you actually came to work at Prune as a line cook. The recipes have been tried, tasted, and tested dozens if not hundreds of times. Intended for the home cook as well as the kitchen professional, the instructions offer a range of signals for cooks\u2014a head\u2019s up on when you have gone too far, things to watch out for that could trip you up, suggestions on how to traverse certain uncomfortable parts of the journey to ultimately help get you to the final destination, an amazing dish.&nbsp;Complete with more than with more than 250 recipes and 250 color photographs, home cooks will find Prune\u2019s most requested recipes\u2014Grilled Head-on Shrimp with Anchovy Butter, Bread Heels and Pan Drippings Salad, Tongue and Octopus with Salsa Verde and Mimosa\u2019d Egg, Roasted Capon on Garlic Crouton, Prune\u2019s famous Bloody Mary (and all 10 variations). Plus, among other items, a chapter entitled \u201cGarbage\u201d\u2014smart ways to repurpose foods that might have hit the garbage or stockpot in other restaurant kitchens but are turned into appetizing bites and notions at Prune.&nbsp;Featured here are the recipes, approach, philosophy, evolution, and nuances that make them distinctively Prune\u2019s. Unconventional and honest, in both tone and content, this book is a welcome expression of the cookbook as we know it.Praise for Prune &nbsp; \u201cFresh, fascinating . . . entirely pleasurable . . . Since 1999, when the chef Gabrielle Hamilton put Triscuits and canned sardines on the first menu of her East Village bistro, Prune, she has nonchalantly broken countless rules of the food world. The rule that a successful restaurant must breed an empire. The rule that chefs who happen to be women should unconditionally support one another. The rule that great chefs don\u2019t make great writers (with her memoir, Blood, Bones &amp; Butter). And now, the rule that restaurant food has to be simplified and prettied up for home cooks in order to produce a useful, irresistible cookbook. . . . [Prune] is the closest thing to the bulging loose-leaf binder, stuck in a corner of almost every restaurant kitchen, ever to be printed and bound between cloth covers. (These happen to be a beautiful deep, dark magenta.)\u201d\u2014The New York Times &nbsp; \u201cOne of the most brilliantly minimalist cookbooks in recent memory . . . at once conveys the thrill of restaurant cooking and the wisdom of the author, while making for a charged reading experience.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly (starred review)",

Allegiances run from the general (Chicago versus New York style, Neapolitan versus Roman) to the particular (Pepe's versus Sally's, Gino's East versus Pizzeria Uno), and new interpretations ever extend the pizza frontier.In AMERICAN PIE, master bread baker Peter Reinhart follows the trail from Italy to the States, capturing the stories behind the greatest artisanal pizzas of the Old World and the New. Beginning his journey in Genoa, Reinhart scours the countryside in search of the fabled focaccia col formaggio. He next heads to Rome to sample the famed seven-foot-long pizza al taglio, and then to Naples for the archetypal pizza napoletana. Back in America, the hunt resumes in the unlikely locale of Phoenix, Arizona, where Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco has convinced many that his pie sets the new standard in the country. The pizza mecca of New Haven, grilled pizza in Providence, the deep-dish pies of Chicago, California-style pizza in San Francisco and Los Angeles\u2014these are just a few of the tasty attractions on Reinhart's epic tour. Returning to the kitchen, Reinhart gives a master class on pizza-making techniques and provides more than 60 recipes for doughs, sauces and toppings, and the pizzas that bring them all together. His insatiable curiosity and gift for storytelling make AMERICAN PIE essential reading for those who aspire to make great pizza at home, as well as for anyone who enjoys the thrill of the hunt.A fascinating look into the great pizzas and pizzerias of Italy and America.Peter Reinhart's last book, THE BREAD BAKER'S APPRENTICE, was named Cookbook of the Year by both the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals.&nbsp;Reviews\u201cPeter Reinhart has taken a deep look into pizza, one of the best and simplest of foods, embracing all its variety.

He tells vivid stories, and his recipes and techniques are thorough and practical. A splendid book.\u201d\u2014Edward Behr, editor, The Art of Eating\u201cI doubt whether anyone else could be as passionate as Peter Reinhart about pizzas or have made such extensive and exciting journeys in pursuing them. He has collected great anecdotes and wonderfully detailed recipes in the course of his intercontinental hunt.\u201d\u2014Alan Davidson, author of The Oxford Companion to Food\u201cWe all know that Peter Reinhart is a great baker and teacher, but now that he's fallen in love with pizza, we can see he's also a great tour guide as he takes us to the best pizzerias in Italy and America. Secrets are divulged, expert tips provided, and stories told.

The culmination of more than fifty years of living, traveling, and cooking in Mexico, The Art of Mexican Cooking is the ultimate guide to creating authentic Mexican food in your own kitchen, with more than 200 beloved recipes as well as evocative illustrations.The dishes included, favorites from all the regions of Mexico, range from sophisticated to pure and simple, but they all share an intrinsic depth of taste. Aficionados will go to great lengths to duplicate the authentic dishes (and Kennedy tells them exactly how), but here too is a wealth of less complicated recipes for the casual cook in search of the unmistakable flavors of a bold cuisine.Kennedy shares the secrets of true Mexican flavor: balancing the piquant taste of chiles with a little salt and acid, for instance, or charring them to round out their flavor; broiling tomatoes to bring out their character, or adding cumin for a light accent. By using Kennedy\u2019s kitchen wisdom and advice, and carefully selecting produce that is now readily available in most American markets, cooks with an appetite for Mexican cuisine\u2013and Kennedy devotees old and new\u2013can at last serve and enjoy real Mexican food.\u201cThis is the ultimate in Mexican cooking from the world\u2019s leading authority.\u201d \u2014Paula Wolfert, author of The Cooking of South-West France",

Born in South Africa, the daughter of a well-known actress, Prue came to London in the early 1960s, set up a successful catering company, and later opened Leith's Restaurant, a food lovers' oasis in London's then gastronomic desert. By the mid-seventies she was a regular food columnist on the Daily Mail, had published several cookbooks and opened Leith's School of Food and Wine. But it wasn't all work. For thirteen years she had a secret affair with the married man who was to be her husband for another twenty-five years. She writes movingly of the anguish for both families; of her longing for children; the birth of her son, Daniel, and the adoption of her daughter, Li-Da. Prue writes with relish, humour and honesty. Whether she is running her own businesses or sitting on the boards of public companies; founding charities or leading institutions, her down-to-earth attitude to triumph and disaster is an inspiration. She is forthright about her love life; her mother's senility; her husband's smoking himself to death; the theft of her savings, and falling in love at sixty-six with a manic-depressive.

Growing up in an all-women household and coddled endlessly by his Italian mother and grandmother, Eric Lindstrom was nourished to obesity on meaty sauces, fried eggs, and butter-laden cookies. After spending the first half of his life as an adamant omnivore, Lindstrom went 100% vegan. Reluctantly. Overnight. From burgers to beets, from pork to parsnips. It\u2019s time for a down-to-earth book that proves anyone can go vegan (even someone who once ate sixty-eight chicken wings in a sitting). How can a man adopt a vegan approach? Won\u2019t he die of protein deficiency? What if he is married to a vegan woman? How would he order a salad at a Minnesota steakhouse? What should he bring to a gluten-free, nut-free, macrobiotic, nightshade-free, oil-free, vegan potluck (true story)? Part confession and part survival guide, The Skeptical Vegan explains how simple it really is to be vegan, covering topics from food and nutrition to social challenges and lifestyle. Snarky, witty, and opinionated to a fault, Lindstrom speaks as a male vegan, contesting the notion that \u201creal men\u201d should only eat meat. With twenty original \u201cveganized\u201d recipes including portobello steaks, carrot hot dogs, tofu wings, \u201cmeaty\u201d chili, and cauliflower bites (which helped him shed thirty pounds), Lindstrom demonstrates how to take control of your diet while still eating \u201cmeatily\u201d and taking into account the ethical considerations of living a better life for the animals, the environment, and yourself.",

        "description": "For twenty-five years, Alice Waters and her friends at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California have dedicated themselves to the ideal of serving the finest, freshest foods with simplicity and style. From tender baby asparagus in early spring, to the colorful spectrum of peppers at the height of summer; crisp, leafy chicories in autumn, to sweet butternut squash in the dark of winter, much of the inspiration about what to put on the menu comes from the high quality produce Waters and her chefs seek out year-round. Using the treasures from the earth, Chez Panisse Vegetables offers endless possibilities for any occasion. Try Grilled Radicchio Risotto with Balsamic Vinegar at your next dinner party, or Pizza with Red and Yellow Peppers for a summer evening at home. Why not forgo green-leaf lettuce, and opt for Artichoke and Grapefruit Salad drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil? Or serve Corn Cakes with fresh berries for breakfast instead of cereal? Throughout Vegetables, Waters shares her energy and enthusiasm for what she describes as \"living foods.\" When she first began in the restaurant business, the selection of good-quality vegetables was so limited that she found herself searching out farmers with whom she might do business. Luckily, today's explosion of markets and organic farms across the country ensures that any home cook can find freshly harvested produce to put on the table. And with the increased popularity of home gardening, more and more people are taking their vegetables straight from the earth and into the kitchen. Cooks, gardeners, vegetarians and everyone who appreciates good food will find Chez Panisse Vegetables to be not only a cookbook, but a valuable resource for selecting and serving fine produce. From popular vegetables like corn, tomatoes and carrots, to more unusual selections like chard, amaranth greens and sorrel, Vegetables offers detailed information about the seasonal availability, proper look, flavor and preparation of each selection. Arranged alphabetically by vegetable, and filled with colorful linocut images, Chez Panisse Vegetables makes it easy for a cook to find a tempting recipe for whatever he or she has brought home from the market.",

        "description": "America\u2019s favorite storyteller, Pat Conroy, is back with a unique cookbook that only he could conceive. Delighting us with tales of his passion for cooking and good food and the people, places, and great meals he has experienced, Conroy mixes them together with mouthwatering recipes from the Deep South and the world beyond.It all started thirty years ago with a chance purchase of The Escoffier Cookbook, an unlikely and daunting introduction for the beginner. But Conroy was more than up to the task. He set out with unwavering determination to learn the basics of French cooking\u2014stocks and dough\u2014and moved swiftly on to veal demi-glace and p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e. With the help of his culinary accomplice, Suzanne Williamson Pollak, Conroy mastered the dishes of his beloved South as well as the cuisine he has savored in places as far away from home as Paris, Rome, and San Francisco. Each chapter opens with a story told with the inimitable brio of the author. We see Conroy in New Orleans celebrating his triumphant novel The Prince of Tides at a new restaurant where there is a contretemps with its hardworking young owner/chef\u2014years later he discovered the earnest young chef was none other than Emeril Lagasse; we accompany Pat and his wife on their honeymoon in Italy and wander with him, wonderstruck, through the markets of Umbria and Rome; we learn how a dinner with his fighter-pilot father was preceded by the Great Santini himself acting out a perilous night flight that would become the last chapters of one of his son\u2019s most beloved novels. These tales and more are followed by corresponding recipes\u2014from Breakfast Shrimp and Grits and Sweet Potato Rolls to Pappardelle with Prosciutto and Chestnuts and Beefsteak Florentine to Peppered Peaches and Creme Brulee. A master storyteller and passionate cook, Conroy believes that \u201cA recipe is a story that ends with a good meal.\u201d\u201cThis book is the story of my life as it relates to the subject of food. It is my autobiography in food and meals and restaurants and countries far and near. Let me take you to a restaurant on the Left Bank of Paris that I found when writing The Lords of Discipline. There are meals I ate in Rome while writing The Prince of Tides that ache in my memory when I resurrect them. There is a shrimp dish I ate in an elegant English restaurant, where Cuban cigars were passed out to all the gentlemen in the room after dinner, that I can taste on my palate as I write this. There is barbecue and its variations in the South, and the subject is a holy one to me. I write of truffles in the Dordogne Valley in France, cilantro in Bangkok, catfish in Alabama, scuppernong in South Carolina, Chinese food from my years in San Francisco, and white asparagus from the first meal my agent took me to in New York City. Let me tell you about the fabulous things I have eaten in my life, the story of the food I have encountered along the way. . . \u201d",

        "description": "Including more than 35 step-by-step recipes from the Black Sheep School of Cheesemaking Most DIY cheesemaking books are hard to follow, complicated, and confusing, and call for the use of packaged freeze-dried cultures, chemical additives, and expensive cheesemaking equipment. For though bread baking has its sourdough, brewing its lambic ales, and pickling its wild fermentation, standard Western cheesemaking practice today is decidedly unnatural. In The Art of Natural Cheesemaking, David Asher practices and preaches a traditional, but increasingly countercultural, way of making cheese\u2015one that is natural and intuitive, grounded in ecological principles and biological science. This book encourages home and small-scale commercial cheesemakers to take a different approach by showing them: \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to source good milk, including raw milk; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to keep their own bacterial starter cultures and fungal ripening cultures; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How make their own rennet\u2015and how to make good cheese without it; \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to avoid the use of plastic equipment and chemical additives; and \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to use appropriate technologies. Introductory chapters explore and explain the basic elements of cheese: milk, cultures, rennet, salt, tools, and the cheese cave. The fourteen chapters that follow each examine a particular class of cheese, from kefir and paneer to washed-rind and alpine styles, offering specific recipes and handling advice. The techniques presented are direct and thorough, fully illustrated with hand-drawn diagrams and triptych photos that show the transformation of cheeses in a comparative and dynamic fashion. The Art of Natural Cheesemaking is the first cheesemaking book to take a political stance against Big Dairy and to criticize both standard industrial and artisanal cheesemaking practices. It promotes the use of ethical animal rennet and protests the use of laboratory-grown freeze-dried cultures. It also explores how GMO technology is creeping into our cheese and the steps we can take to stop it. This book sounds a clarion call to cheesemakers to adopt more natural, sustainable practices. It may well change the way we look at cheese, and how we make it ourselves.",

        "description": "Japanese Farm Food&nbsp;offers a unique look into life on a Japanese farm through 165 simple, clear-flavored recipes along with personal stories and over 350 stunning photographs. It is a book about love, community, and life in rural Japan. Nancy Singleton Hachisu's second book, Preserving the Japanese Way, nominated for the 2016 James Beard Award in the International Cookbook category, takes a deeper look into the techniques, recipes, and local producers associated with Japanese preserving.Gourmand World Cookbook Awards 2012: USA Winner, Best Japanese Cuisine Book \"Our life centers on the farm and the field. We eat what we grow.\" --Nancy Singleton Hachisu,Japanese Farm Food offers a unique window into life on a Japanese farm through the simple, clear-flavored recipes cooked from family crops and other local, organic products. The multitude of vibrant images by Kenji Miura of green fields, a traditional farmhouse, antique baskets, and ceramic bowls filled with beautiful, simple dishes are interwoven with Japanese indigo fabrics to convey an intimate, authentic portrait of life and food on a Japanese farm. With a focus on fresh and thoughtfully sourced ingredients, the recipes in Japanese Farm Food are perfect for fans of farmers' markets, and for home cooks looking for accessible Japanese dishes. Personal stories about family and farm life complete this incredible volume.American born and raised, Nancy Singleton Hachisu lives with her husband and teenage sons on a rural Japanese farm, where they prepare these 165 bright, seasonal dishes. The recipes are organized logically with the intention of reassuring you how easy it is to cook Japanese food. Not just a book about Japanese food, Japanese Farm Food is a book about love, life on the farm, and community. Covering everything from pickles and soups to noodles, rice, and dipping sauces, with a special emphasis on vegetables, Hachisu demystifies the rural Japanese kitchen, laying bare the essential ingredients, equipment, and techniques needed for Japanese home cooking.\"Nancy Hachisu is...intrepid. Outrageously creative. Intensely passionate. Committed. True and real. I urge you to cook from this book with abandon, but first read it like a memoir, chapter by chapter, and you will share in the story of a modern-day family, a totally unique and extraordinary one.\" --Patricia Wells\"This book is both an intimate portrait of Nancy's life on the farm, and an important work that shows the universality of an authentic food culture.\" --Alice Waters\"The modest title Japanese Farm Food turns out to be large, embracing and perhaps surprising. Unlike the farm-to-table life as we know it here, where precious farm foods are cooked with recipes, often with some elaboration, real farm food means eating the same thing day after day when it\u2019s plentiful, putting it up for when it's not, and cooking it very, very simply because the farm demands so much more time in the field than in the kitchen. This beautiful, touching, and ultimately common sense book is about a life that's balanced between the idea that a life chooses you and that you in turn choose it and then live it wholeheartedly and largely. Thank you, Nancy, for sharing your rich, intentional and truly inspiring life.\" --Deborah Madison\"Nancy Hachisu\u2019s amazing depth of knowledge of Japanese food and culture shines through in every part of this book. You will feel as if you live next door to her...savoring and learning her down-to-earth approach to cooking and to loving food.\" --Hiroko Shimbo\"Taking a peek into Nancy Hachisu's stunning Japanese Farm Food is like entering a magical world. It's a Japan that used to be, not the modern Japan defined by the busyness of Tokyo, but a more timeless place, a place whose rhythms are set by seasons and traditions and the work of the farm. Japanese Farm Food is so much more than a cookbook. This book has soul. Every vegetable, every tool has a story. Who grew this eggplant? Who made this soy sauce? Nancy doesn't have to ask, \"Where does my food come from?\" She knows. Here's a woman who grows and harvests her own rice, grain by grain. Not that she asks or expects us to do the same at all. What she does offer is a glimpse into her life in rural Japan, with its shoji screens and filtered light, and recipes from her farm kitchen that you can't wait to try.\" --Elise Bauer, SimplyRecipes.com\"Japanese Farm Food is a lovely book about the culture, landscape, and food of Japan, a true insider's view of the Japanese kitchen, from farm to table, by a passionate and talented writer.\" --Michael Ruhlman",

From blooming tree-picked fruit to farm-raised eggs and fresh-churned butter, Big Mama used what was readily available to invent completely original treats.

Big Mama\u2019s recipes became the fabric of their family heritage. Grandbaby Cakes is Adams\u2019s love note to her family, thanking those who came before and passing on this touching tradition with 50 brilliant cakes.Grandbaby Cakes pairs charming stories of Big Mama\u2019s kitchen with recipes ranging from classic standbys to exciting adventures\u2014helpfully marked by degree of difficulty\u2014that will inspire your own family for years to come.

Combining Shulman?s entertaining and compelling narrative with a wealth of invaluable culinary information, you'll take a \"step up\" in the kitchen with this vicarious adventure through basic training at one of the country?s finest professional cooking schools.DAY 1: \"Our 'drill sergeant' comes into the room and writes his name on the board. He wears the CIA staff jacket, a green name badge, and the chef's kerchief around his neck, which he later shows us how to tie. 'YOU ARE MINE!' he says with a sly smile on his face, and we know that he's going to give us the guidance we need. He'll be strict, but kind.\"DAY 2: \"Until I went to Boot Camp, I was never very comfortable around (or succeessful with) lots of hot oil in a pan. That was all about to change.\"DAY 3: \"One of the most important terms for dry heat cooking is 'carryover cooking.' Carryover cooking refers to the fact that heat penetrates meat from the outside to the inside, and when you remove it from the oven, the meat will continue to cook. That's why it must rest, during which time the carryover cooking continues, the temperature equalizes, and the juices relax and flow through the meat.\"DAY 4: \"Our dessert was a Warm Dark Chocolate Pudding Cake, and it was served with a glass of Quady Elysium from Madera County, California. They named their black muscat dessert wine Elysium because, in their words, 'Drinking this, you can almost feel you have fallen into a rose garden and been transported to heaven.' And I must say I did. I transported myself to bed instead, thinking what an appropriate meal this had been after our first wine lecture, and about the wines I would serve with my own next dinner party.\"DAY 5: \"We sampled each team's handiwork, and as we were polishing off this large meal, our chef stood up to congratulate us and hand out our 'certificates of accomplishment.'\"",

        "description": "What Julia Child is to French cooking and Marcella Hazan is to Italian cooking, Deborah Madison is to contemporary vegetarian cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Greens restaurant in San Francisco, where she was the founding chef, and in her two acclaimed vegetarian cookbooks, Madison elevated vegetarian cooking to new heights of sophistication, introducing many people to the joy of cooking without meat, whether occasionally or for a lifetime.&nbsp;&nbsp;But after her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in a landmark cookbook that has been six years in the making, Madison teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today.Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1,400 recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Becoming a Cook\" teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and \"Foundations of Flavor\" discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.Despite its focus on meatless cooking, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is not just for vegetarians: It's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;And Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.",

The book also highlights how to recognize&nbsp;your reflux trigger foods, how to get off reflux medication, and how to lose weight the right way\u2014and keep it off.  Dr. Koufman\u2019s Acid Reflux Diet includes 111 amazingly delicious and original vegetarian and gluten-free recipes.  Sample Recipes  Roasted Cauliflower &amp; Watercress Chowder  Makes 4 servings \u00a6Vegetarian, Dairy-Free, Gluten-Free  Ingredients  1 head cauliflower, diced (small, bite-sized pieces)  1/2 pound or 2 medium potatoes, diced (small, bite-sized pieces)  1 stalk celery, finely diced  1 carrot, minced or finely diced  1/2 teaspoon sea salt  1 tablespoon safflower oil&nbsp;  1/3 cup raw pistachios, shelled  1/4 cup white miso&nbsp;(optional)  1 small bunch watercress  Olive oil (for garnish) up to one teaspoon per bowl  Directions  - In a roasting pan, add potatoes, celery, carrots, and cauliflower.&nbsp;Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and 1 tablespoon safflower oil.&nbsp;Cover with foil and roast at 425O F for 30 minutes.  - Add 1/2 the roasted vegetables to the blender.&nbsp;Add stock, pistachios, Miso, and watercress to the blender and puree till very smooth.  - Put the mixture into a pot and add the rest of the cooked vegetables.&nbsp;  - Bring to simmer, but do not boil!&nbsp;  - Garnish with a small amount of very good olive oil (optional)  Notes: As a child growing up in Brooklyn, I loved the fresh cauliflower that was available in summer when we would visit Upstate New York. Infatuation with this incredible and versatile vegetable has only grown over the years as I have learned more and more dishes using it. \u2022 This chowder is very popular on my catering menus and has been a huge hit at my underground restaurant in Oakland. \u2022 Basil can be substituted for watercress. \u2022 This soup is also great for a winter evening because it is hearty. \u2022 When you prepare the cauliflower and potatoes, remember that these need to be bite size. \u2022&nbsp; For gluten-free diets, avoid mugi miso which is made with barley; and for those preferring to avoid soy, use chickpea misos. Chef Philip  Steamed Sea Bass with Ginger &amp; Soy  Makes 4 servings \u00a6 Dairy-Free, Gluten-Free   Ingredients  2 pounds sea bass fillet (or any other flaky white fish)  2 teaspoons sea salt  1 inch of ginger root, peeled and cut into thin matchsticks  1 1/2 tablespoon rice wine (or any dry white wine)  2 tablespoon soy sauce (Tamari, gluten-free soy)  4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil* (optional)  1 tablespoon olive oil  1/2 cup fresh cilantro sprigs  Directions  - Salt both side of fillet.&nbsp;  - Scatter ginger over top of fish.  - Drizzle rice wine over the fish and place on heat proof dish for steaming.&nbsp;  - Place in steamer and cover, and steam for 10-15 minutes.  - Pour water out of the dish.  - Drizzle soy sauce over the fish.&nbsp;  - Heat toasted sesame oil and olive oil over medium-high heat until they begin to smoke and then pour it carefully over the fish.&nbsp;  - Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.  Notes: Sesame oil may be a trigger food for some people, which is&nbsp; why it is optional. \u2022 Halibut is quite expensive and this dish can be made with almost any flaky white fish; ask your fish department for suggestions. \u2022 In stead of steaming, you can poach the fish. To poach, follow the recipe until just before \u201cplacing in steamer,\u201d and place in a skillet, then add 2 cups of chicken stock, bring to boil, reduce heat to simmer, cover, and poach for 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; Then, continue cooking instructions from \u201cpour water out of the dish.\u201d Sonia  Kick-Ass Carrot Cookies  Makes 3 dozen \u00a6Vegetarian, Dairy-Free  Ingredients  1 cup oats  1 cup flour  1 teaspoon cinnamon  1 teaspoon baking powder  1/2 teaspoon baking soda  1/4 teaspoon salt  1/2 cup maple syrup  1/2 cup grape seed oil  1 cup grated carrots  1/2 cup dried cherries (optional; see Notes)  Directions  - preheat oven to 375O F  - In one bowl, combine oats, flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt.  - In a separate bowl, whisk together maple and oil.  - Add carrots and dried fruit to this mix and blend well.  - Pour the wet mix over the dry mix and gently combine. Do NOT over-mix or the cookies will be rubbery.  - These cookies only bake well if they are small.  - Drop 1 teaspoon on an oiled baking sheet, 2 inches apart.  - Bake at 375 degrees&nbsp;F for 10 minutes.  - Be careful not to overcook these cookies as they burn easily after they are complete.  Note: Dried cherries may be a trigger food for some people, and they may be replaced by currants, raisins, dried blueberries, or dried cranberries \u2026 or a combination. Chef Philip",

Bien Cuit: The Art of Bread&nbsp;is a work of art and has been specially produced and manufactured with an elegant, sophisticated design. This stunning&nbsp;package features&nbsp;an exposed spine, images from famed food photographer Thomas Schauer, and a beautifully designed interior.Bien Cuit&nbsp;introduces a new approach to a proudly old-fashioned way of baking bread. In the oven of his Brooklyn bakery, Chef Zachary Golper creates loaves that are served in New York\u2019s top restaurants and sought by bread enthusiasts around the country. His secret: long, low-temperature fermentation, which allows the dough to develop deep, complex flavors. A thick mahogany-colored crust is his trademark\u2014what the French call&nbsp;bien cuit, or \u201cwell baked.\u201d&nbsp;This signature style is the product of Golper\u2019s years as a journeyman baker, from his introduction to baking on an Oregon farm\u2014where they made bread by candlelight at 1 a.m.\u2014through top kitchens in America and Europe and, finally, into his own bakery in the heart of our country\u2019s modern artisanal food scene.&nbsp;  Bien Cuit&nbsp;tells the story of Golper\u2019s ongoing quest to coax maximum flavor out of one of the world\u2019s oldest and simplest recipes. Readers and amateur bakers will reap the rewards of his curiosity and perfectionism in the form of fifty bread recipes that span the baking spectrum from rolls and quick breads to his famous 24-day sourdough starter. This book is an homage to tradition, but also to invention. Golper developed many new recipes for this book, including several \u201cbread quests,\u201d in which he brilliantly revives some of New York City\u2019s most iconic breads (including Jewish rye, Sicilian lard bread, Kaiser rolls, and, of course, bagels). You will also find palate-pleasing and innovative \u201cgastronomic breads\u201d that showcase his chef\u2019s intuition and mastery of ingredients.  Golper\u2019s defining technique comes at a time when American home cooks are returning to tradition-tested cooking methods and championing the DIY movement. Golper\u2019s methods are relatively simple and easy to master, with recipes that require no modern equipment to make at home: just a bowl, an oven, and time\u2014the dough does most of the work.",

A bowl of Summer Squash Soup or a couple of Chanterelle Tacos make for a light and healthy lunch, and for dinner, there\u2019s Black Sesame Otsu, Pomegranate-Glazed Eggplant with Tempeh, or the aptly named Weeknight Curry. Heidi\u2019s Rose Geranium Prosecco is the perfect start to a celebratory meal, and the Buttermilk Cake with fresh plums or Sweet Panzanella will satisfy even the most stubborn sweet tooth.&nbsp;Gorgeously illustrated with over 100 photos that showcase the engaging rhythms of Heidi\u2019s culinary life and travels, Super Natural Every Day reveals the beauty of uncomplicated food prepared well and reflects a realistic yet gourmet approach to a healthy and sophisticated natural foods lifestyle.",

        "description": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor one of the fastest growing segments of the food service business is providing professional personal chef services. Personal chefs can expect to make between $100 and $400 a day every day. Until recently having a chef prepare food for you and your family was considered a luxury for only the wealthy. Today, many individuals and families have discovered that a personal chef service is an affordable, time saving, and healthy alternative to the stress and time constraints of working to put a wholesome, economical, and tasty meal on the table every night.   A personal chef offers a professional service of meal preparation. A client's individual tastes drive the creation of their customized menu. These personalized meals are prepared either in the client s home or your catering kitchen and then packaged, labeled, possibly delivered, and stored in the refrigerator or freezer. Most services include complete grocery shopping, customized menu planning, and storage in oven/microwavable containers.&lt;br. Families in which both spouses work, singles and couples who work long, hard hours, seniors who would rather not or cannot cook anymore, gourmets who love to cook but who do not always have the time, and individuals that have medical conditions, such as wheat/gluten intolerance, milk or other sensitivities, diabetes, or high blood pressure, who require specialized meals will seek your services.   This book will not teach you how to cook, although there are some sample menus. What you will learn is all the aspects of starting your business, pricing your products, marketing your business, and conducting your day-to-day business operations. This comprehensive new book will show you step-by-step how to set up, operate, and manage a financially successful personal chef business. The author has left no stone unturned in explaining the risky business of food service.   The book covers the entire process of a personal chef business from startup to ongoing management in an easy to understand way, pointing out methods to increase your chances of success and showing you how to avoid the common mistakes that can doom a startup. While providing detailed instructions and examples, the author leads you through finding a location that will bring success (in your home or a rented kitchen), managing and training employees, accounting and bookkeeping procedures, auditing, successful budgeting, and profit planning development, as well as thousands of great tips and useful guidelines.  You also will learn how to draw up a winning business plan, how to set up computer systems to save time and money, how to hire and keep a qualified staff, how to generate high profile public relations, and how to keep bringing customers back. In addition, you will become familiar with basic cost control systems, profitable menu planning, successful kitchen management, equipment layout and planning, food safety and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), low cost marketing ideas, and low and no cost ways to satisfy customers and build sales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion CD-ROM is included with the print version of this book; however is not available for download with the electronic version.&nbsp; It may be obtained separately by contacting Atlantic Publishing Group at sales@atlantic-pub.com   Atlantic Publishing is a small, independent publishing company based in Ocala, Florida.

Sandor Katz presents the concepts and processes behind fermentation in ways that are simple enough to guide a reader through their first experience making sauerkraut or yogurt, and in-depth enough to provide greater understanding and insight for experienced practitioners. While Katz expertly contextualizes fermentation in terms of biological and cultural evolution, health and nutrition, and even economics, this is primarily a compendium of practical information\u2015how the processes work; parameters for safety; techniques for effective preservation; troubleshooting; and more. With two-color illustrations and extended resources, this book provides essential wisdom for cooks, homesteaders, farmers, gleaners, foragers, and food lovers of any kind who want to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for arguably the oldest form of food preservation, and part of the roots of culture itself. Readers will find detailed information on fermenting vegetables; sugars into alcohol (meads, wines, and ciders); sour tonic beverages; milk; grains and starchy tubers; beers (and other grain-based alcoholic beverages); beans; seeds; nuts; fish; meat; and eggs, as well as growing mold cultures, using fermentation in agriculture, art, and energy production, and considerations for commercial enterprises. Sandor Katz has introduced what will undoubtedly remain a classic in food literature, and is the first\u2015and only\u2015of its kind.",

It might feel like this favorite treat is part of our national heritage, perhaps dating back to the founding fathers, but not until 1930 was the first batch impulsively baked in the kitchen of a Massachusetts inn. How quickly it became our nation\u2019s favorite is what makes the chocolate chip cookie more relentlessly American than even apple pie.

Get to know the first chocolate chip cookie-preneurs and their unlikely success stories.

        "description": "2014 marks the twentieth anniversary of the acclaimed French Laundry restaurant in the Napa Valley\u2014\u201cthe most exciting place to eat in the United States\u201d (The New York Times). The most transformative cookbook of the century celebrates this milestone by showcasing the genius of chef/proprietor Thomas Keller himself. Keller is a wizard, a purist, a man obsessed with getting it right. And this, his first cookbook, is every bit as satisfying as a French Laundry meal itself: a series of small, impeccable, highly refined, intensely focused courses. Most dazzling is how simple Keller's methods are: squeegeeing the moisture from the skin on fish so it saut\u00e9es beautifully; poaching eggs in a deep pot of water for perfect shape; the initial steeping in the shell that makes cooking raw lobster out of the shell a cinch; using vinegar as a flavor enhancer; the repeated washing of bones for stock for the cleanest, clearest tastes. From innovative soup techniques, to the proper way to cook green vegetables, to secrets of great fish cookery, to the creation of breathtaking desserts; from beurre mont\u00e9 to foie gras au torchon, to a wild and thoroughly unexpected take on coffee and doughnuts, The French Laundry Cookbook captures, through recipes, essays, profiles, and extraordinary photography, one of America's great restaurants, its great chef, and the food that makes both unique. One hundred and fifty superlative recipes are exact recipes from the French Laundry kitchen\u2014no shortcuts have been taken, no critical steps ignored, all have been thoroughly tested in home kitchens. If you can't get to the French Laundry, you can now re-create at home the very experience Wine Spectator described as \u201cas close to dining perfection as it gets.\u201d &nbsp;",

Many of us know it for its \"hot and spicy\" reputation or a few of its most famous dishes, most notably Kung Pao chicken, but that is only the beginning. Sichuanese cuisine is legendary in China for its sophistication and astounding diversity: local gourmets claim the region boasts 5000 different dishes. Fuchsia Dunlop fell in love with Sichuanese food on her first visit to the province ten years ago. The following year she went to live in the Sichuanese capital Chengdu, where she became the first foreigner to study full-time at the province's famous cooking school, the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine. Now she has given us a cookbook gathered on the spot from the kitchens of Sichuan, filled with stories and colorful descriptions of the region itself. Useful for the enthusiastic beginner as well as the experienced cook, Land of Plenty teaches you not only how to prepare the Sichuan recipes but also the art of chopping and to appreciate the textures of dishes. Among this book's unique features: a full glossary of Chinese terms; Chinese characters useful for shopping; a practical introduction to the art of cutting; detailed lists of the 23 recognized flavor combinations and 56 cooking methods used in Sichuanese cuisine; 16 color pictures of the ingredients and finished dishes; double-page maps of the region; and Chinese characters for every recipe",

        "description": "Is the world ready to rethink bread making? MaryJane Butters thinks so. Wild Bread completely reinvents the concept of healthier-for-you, naturally fermented sourdough. Until now, sourdough was perceived as too much work and sour-tasting, artisan-style-only loaves. In Wild Bread, her quick and easy 1 minute 2x/day technique demonstrates the use of eight different types of flours for each bread featured\u2015everything from gluten-free brown-rice flour to quinoa to common white to heirloom whole wheat\u2015for a whopping 295 recipes and 475 photographs.  Using her step-by-step method, every style of bread imaginable, including gluten-free, will loft with wild abandon without the purchase of a single packet of not-so-healthy, store-bought yeast. In nutritionally superior wild-yeast bread, fermentation triggers the release of vital nutrients and breaks down carbohydrates. In MaryJane\u2019s world, there\u2019s no such thing as too much bread because once you convert to slow-rise wild-bread making, that bagel you\u2019ve been thinking about is more like a vitamin pill than a source of \u201ccarb-loaded\u201d guilt. Lessons gleaned from MaryJane Butters\u2019 diverse pioneering background, from carpenter to dairy owner to former wilderness ranger turned organic farmer, led her eventually to stewardship of the 4-story, historic Barron Flour Mill. It was only natural that her years spent living on remote Forest Service fire-watch towers with only a living, breathing sourdough \u201cmother\u201d for companionship would lead her to write a pioneering wild-yeast bread book. She is the author of eight books; editor of MaryJanesFarm magazine, now in its 18th year of publication; and lives on an organic farm in Idaho. Two of her grown children and their spouses are employed full-time at her farm and she is \u201cNanny\u201d to half a dozen grandchildren.",

Since then she has spent months on end taking walkabouts in the wild, eating nothing but what she forages, and has become a wild-foods advocate, community activist, gardener, and chef, teaching and presenting internationally about foraging and the healthful lifestyle it promotes.&nbsp;  Katrina Blair\u2019s philosophy in The Wild Wisdom of Weeds&nbsp;is sobering, realistic, and ultimately optimistic. If we can open our eyes to see the wisdom found in these weeds right under our noses, instead of trying to eradicate an \u201cinvasive,\u201d we will achieve true food security. The Wild Wisdom of Weeds is about healing ourselves both in body and in spirit, in an age where technology, commodity agriculture, and processed foods dictate the terms of our intelligence. But if we can become familiar with these thirteen edible survival weeds found all over the world, we will never go hungry, and we will become closer to our own wild human instincts\u2015all the while enjoying the freshest, wildest, and most nutritious food there is. For free!  The thirteen plants found growing in every region across the world are: dandelion, mallow, purslane, plantain, thistle, amaranth, dock, mustard, grass, chickweed, clover, lambsquarter, and knotweed.&nbsp; These special plants contribute to the regeneration of the earth while supporting the survival of our human species; they grow everywhere where human civilization exists, from the hottest deserts to the Arctic Circle, following the path of human disturbance. Indeed, the more humans disturb the earth and put our food supply at risk, the more these thirteen plants proliferate. It\u2019s a survival plan for the ages.  Including over one hundred unique recipes, Katrina Blair\u2019s book teaches us how to prepare these wild plants from root to seed in soups, salads, slaws, crackers, pestos, seed breads, and seed butters; cereals, green powders, sauerkrauts, smoothies, and milks; first-aid concoctions such as tinctures, teas, salves, and soothers; self-care/beauty products including shampoo, mouthwash, toothpaste (and brush), face masks; and a lot more. Whether readers are based at home or traveling, this book aims to empower individuals to maintain a state of optimal health with minimal cost and effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;",

I see deep red colours from lots of Kashmiri chillis, tinged with a suggestion of yellow from turmeric. I think of the tandoor oven, and slightly scorched naan shining with ghee and garlic. When Indians talk of their food, they talk about their life. To understand this country, you need to understand curry.What makes a good curry? Sensual spicy aromas or thick, creamy sauces? Rich, dark dals or crispy fried street snacks? Rick journeys through India to find the answer, searching this colorful, chaotic nation in search of the truths behind&nbsp;the world's&nbsp;love affair with its food. Chefs, home cooks, and street vendors hold the key to unlocking the secrets of these complex and diverse flavors, and Rick's travels take him to the heart of both their long-held traditions and most modern techniques. He uncovers recipes for fragrant kormas, delicate spiced fish, and slow-cooked biryanis, all the while gathering ideas and inspiration for his own take on that elusive dish\u2014the perfect curry. Includes metric measures.",

        "description": "Great day in the morning, BakeWise is out! You are holding the book that everyone has been waiting for. Sure enough, Shirley did not hold back\u2014it's all here. Lively and fascinating, BakeWise reads like a mystery novel as we follow sleuth Shirley while she solves everything from why cakes and muffins can be dry to g\u00e9noise deflation and why the cookie crumbles.With her years of experience from big-pot cooking for 140 teenage boys and her classic French culinary training to her work as a research biochemist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Shirley manages to put two and two together in unique and exciting ways. Some information is straight out of Shirley's wildly connecting brain cells. She describes useful techniques, such as brushing puff pastry with ice water\u2014not just brushing off the flour\u2014making the puff pastry easier to roll. The result? Higher, lighter, and flakier pastry. And you won't find these recipes anywhere else, not even on the Internet. She can help you make moist cakes; flaky pie crusts; shrink-proof perfect meringues that won't leak but still cut like a dream; big, crisp cream puffs; amazing French pastries; light g\u00e9noise; and crusty, incredibly flavorful, open-textured French breads, such as baguettes and fougasses.  There is simply no one like Shirley Corriher. People everywhere recognize her from her TV appearances on the Food Network and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, with Snoop Dogg as her fry chef.  Restaurant chefs and culinary students know her from their grease-splattered copies of CookWise, an encyclopedic work that has saved them from many a cooking disaster. With numerous \u201cAt-a-Glance\u201d charts, BakeWise gives busy people information for quick problem solving. BakeWise also includes Shirley's \u201cWhat This Recipe Shows\u201d in every recipe. This section is science and culinary information that can apply to hundreds of recipes, not just the one in which it appears. For years, food editors and writers have kept CookWise, Shirley's previous book, right by their computers. Now that spot they've been holding for BakeWise can be filled. BakeWise does not have just a single source of knowledge; Shirley loves reading the works of chefs and other good cooks and shares their information with you, too. She applies not only her expertise but that of the many artisans she admires, such as famous French pastry chefs Gaston Len\u00f4tre and Chef Roland Mesnier, the White House executive pastry chef for twenty-five years; Bruce Healy, author of Mastering the Art of French Pastry; and Bonnie Wagner, Shirley's daughter-inlaw's mother. Shirley also retrieves \"lost arts\" from experts of the past such as Monroe Boston Strause, the pie master of 1930s America.

        "description": "Did you know?... Known as Mother Nature's \"nectar of the gods,\" honey was praised for its healing powers as far back as 5,000 years ago by Egyptians. Eating honey can help lower the risk of heart disease, cancer , diabetes--even help reduce body fat and unwanted weight!--and increase longevity. Pure, raw, unprocessed honey is a healthier sweetener than table sugar and high fructose corn syrup. It's chock-full of antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins--and only has 21 calories per teaspoon. Super \"bee foods\" (including nutrient-rich bee pollen, propolis, and royal jelly) are used and touted for their healing powers by beekeepers and medical experts in the present-day. Honey can relieve a variety of ailments, including allergies, coughs, fatigue, pain, and stress, as well as boost libido. The honey bee pollinates about one-third of the food we consume (including nutritious fruits and nuts). Drawing on the latest honey buzz and interviews with medical doctors, beekeepers, and researchers, this charming and enlightening book (sweetened with stories about honey bees and humans) reveals 30 healing honey varieties paired with cinnamon and teas, tells you how to incorporate honey into Mediterranean-style, heart-healthy recipes like Honey Custard French Toast, Honey-Glazed Game Hen, and Filo Pear and Honey Tarts, and provides more than 50 home cures that combat digestive woes to skin woes. You'll also enjoy Cleopatra's milk-and-honey beauty treatments and eco-friendly beeswax household uses--all made with the amazing honey bee's gifts! \"A fascinating read about a natural remedy that is a rich source of antioxidants.\" --Ray Sahelian, M.D., author of Mind Boosters \"This eye-opening book provides you with a delicious truth of the traditional Mediterranean diet: Honey is a sumptuous route to optimal health.\" --Dr. Will Clower, Ph.D., author of The French Don't Diet Plan",

        "description": "**Now a docu-series streaming on Netflix, starring Pollan as he explores how cooking transforms food and shapes our world. Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney executive produces the four-part series based on Pollan's book, and each episode will focus on a different natural element: fire, water, air, and earth. **In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements\u2014fire, water, air, and earth\u2014to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan\u2019s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse\u2013trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \u201cfermentos\u201d (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us. The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.",

A Baker\u2019s Year takes readers month-by-month through the seasons at Smoke Signals for porridge and waffles in winter, crusty bread in spring, pies and pizza in the summer, and celebration cakes for end-of-the-year holidays. Along the way, Tara writes about how to live in a more peaceful world, shares stories from her own life, mourns romances lost, and celebrates the promise of a new relationship. Illustrated throughout with Tara's photographs and drawings, A Baker\u2019s Year is a true American original destined to be a classic of cookbook shelves.",

It takes the kitchen memoir to a rough and reckless place. From his first job scraping trays at a pizzeria at age fifteen, Jason Sheehan worked on the line at all kinds of restaurants: a French colonial and an all-night diner, a crab shack just off the interstate and a fusion restaurant in a former hair salon. Restaurant work, as he describes it in exuberant, sparkling prose, is a way of life in which \u201cyour whole universe becomes a small, hot steel box filled with knives and meat and fire.\u201d The kitchen crew is a fraternity with its own rites: cigarettes in the walk-in freezer, sex in the basement, the wartime urgency of the dinner rush. Cooking is a series of personal challenges, from the first perfectly done mussel to the satisfaction of surgically sliced foie gras. And the kitchen itself, as he tells it, is a place in which life\u2019s mysteries are thawed, sliced, broiled, barbecued, and fried\u2014a place where people from the margins find their community and their calling. With this deeply affecting book, Sheehan (already acclaimed for his reviews) joins the first class of American food writers at a time when books about food have never been better or more popular. ",

        "description": "Pam Anderson grew up watching her parents and grandparents make dinner every night by simply taking the ingredients on hand and cooking them with the techniques they knew. Times have changed. Today we have an overwhelming array of ingredients and a fraction of the cooking time, but Anderson believes the secret to getting dinner on the table lies in the past. After a long day, who has the energy to look up a recipe and search for the right ingredients before ever starting to cook? To make dinner night after night, Anderson believes the first two steps--looking for a recipe, then scrambling for the exact ingredients--must be eliminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that most recipes are simply \"variations on a theme,\" she innovatively teaches technique, ultimately eliminating the need for recipes.Once the technique or formula is mastered, Anderson encourages inexperienced as well as veteran cooks to spread their culinary wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, after learning to sear a steak, it's understood that the same method works for scallops, tuna, hamburger, swordfish, salmon, pork tenderloin, and more. You never need to look at a recipe again. Vary the look and flavor of these dishes with interchangeable pan sauces, salsas, relishes, and butters.Best of all, these recipes rise above the mundane Monday-through-Friday fare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine homemade ravioli and lasagna for weeknight supper, or from-scratch tomato sauce before the pasta water has even boiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last-minute guests? Dress up simple tomato sauce with capers and olives or shrimp and red pepper flakes. Drizzle saut\u00e9ed chicken breasts with a balsamic vinegar pan sauce. Anderson teaches you how to do it--without a recipe. Don't buy exotic ingredients and follow tedious instructions for making hors d'oeuvres. Forage through the pantry and refrigerator for quick appetizers. The ingredients are all there; the method is in your head. Master four simple potato dishes--a bake, a cake, a mash, and a roast--compatible with many meals. Learn how to make the five-minute dinner salad, easily changing its look and flavor depending on the season and occasion. Tuck a few dessert techniques in your back pocket and effortlessly turn any meal into a special occasion.There's real rhyme and reason to Pam's method at the beginning of every chapter: To dress greens, \"Drizzle salad with oil, salt, and pepper, then toss until just slick. Sprinkle in some vinegar to give it a little kick.\" To make a frittata, \"Cook eggs without stirring until set around the edges. Bake until puffy, then cut it into wedges.\" Each chapter also contains a helpful at-a-glance chart that highlights the key points of every technique, and a master recipe with enough variations to keep you going until you've learned how to cook without a book.",

She shows the busy, harried family that cooking healthy is simple and that cooking Indian is just a matter of understanding a few key spices.As Singla sees it, acquiring and using the proper spices is the key to preparing her healthful recipes at home. Singla has recently brought to market her own line of traditional Indian spice trays (also known as a masala dabba), which is being sold by retail outlets like Williams-Sonoma.

It was one of the very first books to discuss the negative health effects of eating genetically modified foods and animal products of all kinds, to expose the dangers inherent in our factory farming system, and to advocate a complete plant-based diet. The book garnered endorsements by everyone from Paul Hawken to Neal Donald Walsch, Marianne Williamson to Julia Butterfly Hill.

Leading baker and instructor Richard Miscovich wants people to use their ovens to fulfill the goal of maximum heat utilization. Readers will find methods and techniques for cooking and baking in a wood-fired oven in the order of the appropriate temperature window. What comes first\u2015pizza, or pastry? Roasted vegetables or a braised pork loin? Clarified butter or beef jerky? In addition to an extensive section of delicious formulas for many types of bread, readers will find chapters on:  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making pizza and other live-fire flatbreads;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roasting fish and meats;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grilling, steaming, braising, and frying;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baking pastry and other recipes beyond breads;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendering animal fats and clarifying butter;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food dehydration and infusing oils;  \u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And myriad other ways to use the oven's residual heat.   Appendices include oven-design recommendations, a sample oven temperature log, Richard's baker's percentages, proper care of a sourdough starter, and more. . . .   From the Wood Fired Oven is more than a cookbook; it reminds the reader of how a wood-fired oven (and fire, by extension) draws people together and bestows a sense of comfort and fellowship, very real human needs, especially in uncertain times.

        "description": "Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of successful books in the vegetarian/vegan category. Her earlier cookbook, Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow-Cooker, established her bona fides as an expert on the creative use of slow-cookers, and her entire body of work speaks to her ingenuity in the kitchen and the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker provides practical guidence on how to work with different models of slow-cookers, taking into account the sizes of various machines, the variety of settings they offer, and the quirks and personalities of each device. She addresses any lingering skepticism readers may have about whether slow-cookers can have delicious, meat-free applications, and she shows how to take into account the water content of vegetables and the absorptive qualities of grains when vegan slow-cooking. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker includes eleven recipe chapters, four of which focus on main courses. There are homey and comforting foods in the American and European style, such as a Rustic Pot Pie Topped with Chive Biscuits and a Ziti with Mushroom and Bell Pepper Ragu, and there are lots of East Asian, South and Southeast Asian, and Mexican/Latin dishes, too. Beans, which cook slowly under any circumstance, are fabulously well-suited to the slow cooker, and Robertson includes such appealing recipes as a Crockery Cassoulet and a Greek-Style Beans with Tomatoes and Spinach. Eighteen robust chilis and stews - two more categories that do well in the slow-cooker - include a warming Chipotle Black Bean Chili with Winter Squash and a surprising but yummy Seitan Stroganoff. Beyond the mains, there are chapters devoted to snacks and appetizers, desserts, breads and breakfasts, and even one on drinks. The many soy-free and gluten-free recipes are clearly identified. Altogether, the collection offers readers loads of ways to expand their vegan repertoire and to get maximum value from their investment in a slow-cooker.",

Completely updating it for the first time since 1979, Marion Cunningham made Fannie Farmer once again a household word for a new generation of cooks.What makes this basic cookbook so distinctive is that Marion Cunningham, who is the personification of the nineteenth-century teacher, is always at your side with her forthright tips and comments, encouraging the beginning cook and inspiring the more adventurous. She knows what today's cooks are looking for, and she has a way of instilling confidence and joy in the act of cooking.In giving the book new life, Mrs. Cunningham has been careful always to preserve the best of the old. She has retained all the particularly good, tried-and-true recipes from preceding editions, retesting and rewriting when necessary. She has rediscovered lost treasures, including delicious recipes that were eliminated when practically no one baked bread at home. This is now the place to find the finest possible recipes for Pumpkin Soup, Boston Baked Beans, Carpetbag Steak, Roast Stuffed Turkey, Anadama Bread, Indian Pudding, Apple Pie, and all of the other traditional favorites.The new recipes reflect ethnic influences\u2014Mediterranean, Moroccan, Asian\u2014that have been adding their flavors to American cooking in recent years. Tucked in among all your favorites like Old-Fashioned Beef Stew, New England Clam Chowder, Ham Timbales, and Chicken Jambalaya, you'll find her cool Cucumber Sushi, Enchiladas with Chicken and Green Sauce, or a layered dish of Polenta and Fish to add variety to your repertoire. Always a champion of old-fashioned breakfasts and delectable desserts, Mrs. Cunningham has many splendid new offerings to tempt you. Throughout, cooking terms and procedures are explained, essential ingredients are spelled out, basic equipment is assessed. Mrs. Cunningham even tells you how to make a good cup of coffee and how to brew tea properly. For the diet-conscious, there is an expanded nutritional chart that includes a breakdown of cholesterol and fat in common ingredients as well as in Fannie Farmer basic recipes. Where the taste of a dish would not be altered, Mrs. Cunningham has reduced the amount of cream and butter in some of the recipes from the preceding edition. She carefully evaluates the issues of food safety today and alerts us to potential hazards.But the emphasis here is always on good flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of variety in one's daily fare, which Marion Cunningham believes is the secret to a healthy diet. Dedicated to the home cooks of America, young and old, this thirteenth edition of the book that won the hearts of Americans more than a century ago invites us all\u2014as did the original Fannie Farmer\u2014to cherish the delights of the family table.",

The book ends with them moving to a new farm, and starting a new wonderful life where they will live on the Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary to care for other animals and just live happily ever after... Or so they thought. People often think about giving it all up and just moving to a farm. In theory it sure does sound great. But as Derek and Steve quickly realized, the realities of being a farmer--especially when you have never lived on a farm let alone outside of the city--can be frantic, crazy, and even insane. Not only are they adjusting to farm life and dutifully taking care of their pig-daughter Esther (who by the way lives in the master bedroom of their house), but before they knew it their sanctuary grew to as many as 42 animals, including: pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens, cows, roosters, a peacock, a duck, a horse, a donkey, and a barn cat named Willma Ferrell. Written with joy and humor, and filled with delicious Esther-approved recipes dispersed throughout the book, this charming memoir captures an emotional journey of one little family advocating for animals everywhere.

Knowing from her own hard-won experience that bread is the greatest loss for the wheat, oats, rye, or barley intolerant, she has experimented with exciting new bean-based flours and now devotes an entire book to breads. Here are yeast breads, yeast-free breads, muffins, rolls, buns, breakfast breads, and crackers-a veritable cornucopia to be made in the oven or the bread machine for people who cannot buy breads at a bakery or supermarket but must rely on their own kitchens to provide the staff of life.Along with dozens of great recipes comes a medical foreword by Peter H.

        "description": "\"It\u2019s a conundrum I can\u2019t understand. Someone\u2019s hankering for pie; you can see the pie-longing in their eyes. They want a delicious flaky crust, something with buttery overtones. They want fresh fruit\u2015not a vague whisper of berry in a butter cream, but overt chunks of apple, discernible bites of berry. But it\u2019s just not done. You don\u2019t serve pie at special events like fiftieth birthdays, dinner parties, silveranniversaries, or, God forbid, at a wedding. To which I reply, \u2018Bullpuckies.\u2019\" And so begins Pie It Forward: Pies, Tarts, Tortes, Galettes, and Other Pastries Reinvented. Pie has always been a popular cookbook topic, yet in Pie It Forward, baker, confectioner, and pastry master Gesine Bullock-Prado unveils an entirely new frontier of pies, redefining what can be done with a piecrust and pastry shell. Expect lattice and cutouts with an entirely modern twist. Homemade puff pastry made easy. Individual pie pops to replace tiredcupcakes. Surprising and wildly successful explorations with beer (Chocolate Stout Pudding Pie), exotic fruits (Yuzu-Ginger Rice Pudding Meringue Pie), and candy making (Earl Grey Truffle Tart). And there are the classics too\u2015riffing on her German roots, her Hollywood background, and life on her Vermont farm\u2015a Blueberry Brown Butter Tart, an Italian Plum Tart with a yeasted-dough crust, a tiramisu-inspired Espresso Tart, a Vermont Pizza Pie, and more. Including sweet, savory, layered, and miniature pies and tarts, Bullock-Prado presents these recipes with a voice that removes the intimidation factor and inspires readers to break out of the double-crust straitjacket and try her signaturecreations\u2015and to laugh out loud along the way. For additional information, technique demonstrations, and more, please visit www.pieitforwardcookbook.com.  Praise for Pie it Forward: \u201cDelicious reworkings and inventions from Sandra Bullock\u2019s sister, including a truly quick puff pastry that\u2019s worth the price of the book.\u201d \u2015New York Times Book Review  \"A slice of heaven.\" \u2015US Weekly  \"In Pie it Forward, Gesine Bullock-Prado satisfies even the most demanding sweet tooth.\" \u2015National Examiner  \"Pie it Forward by Gesine Bullock-Prado grabs you with the delectable cover, and holds you with its mouth-watering recipes. My favorite so far, the unbearably amazing pear and rhubarb cardamom custard pie, tastes both cozy and original in the best way possible.\" \u2015Campus Circle  \u201cWork your way through her beginning section on crusts\u2015the thing that scares bakers off pies\u2015and you will be an expert from puff pastry to pizza dough. . . .

FODMAPs are sugars found in certain foods that can be hard to digest, and can cause discomfort, gas, and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) symptoms. Some of the most nutritious foods around are high in these sugars, frustrating people who eat well but still have tummy issues. Apples, garlic, onions, beans, dairy, bread, and cereals are on that list. It may sound complicated or far-fetched but the many converts who have tried the science-supported diet swear by it. In addition to useful everyday advice, the book includes:The differences and similarities between this diet and a gluten-free diet7-day sample menu plan with recipesSimple and easy recipes for the basic items you need to adapt to fit into the low-FODMAP diet, including staples like salad dressing, marinade, and dipsClear explanations for the science behind the low-FODMAP diet and why it works 40 color photographs",

This elegant, must-have cookbook offers exceptional recipes with exquisite results--perfect for passionate home bakers.An updated version of the best-selling debut from Giselle Courteau, this beautiful cookbook is packed with stunning recipes with spectacular results. The ideas from this cookbook can be traced back to Giselle's experiences teaching English in Japan in 2007. It was in Tokyo that Giselle, a self-taught baker, first discovered French macarons and became determined to replicate the delicate confections at home. After experimenting with hundreds of different recipes, all in a tiny toaster oven, Giselle finally perfected a macaron recipe that inspired her to open a French Patisserie in Canada in 2009. That macaron recipe is featured in this cookbook and macarons have been (and continue to be) the bestselling item at Duchess Bake Shop since it first opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macarons aside, Giselle's expertise in all things French patisserie is clear throughout this cookbook. Inside, you'll find standout recipes for Pains au Chocolat, Brioche, and Tartiflette. The cookbook also features contemporary twists on classics including The Duchess, a modern take on the Swedish Princess Cake; Duchess St. Honor\u00e9, a combination of two pastries (puff and p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux); and delicious Canadian-inspired pastries such as Farmer's Saskatoon Pie, Butter Tarts, and the Courteau Family Tourti\u00e8re. This new edition will also include Duchess Bake Shop's famed Buche de Noel, a perfect recipe for the holiday season! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ten chapters of approachable recipes that have been tested and re-tested, Giselle's instructions demystify the baking process. This cookbook will inspire readers to bake with confidence using a range of baking equipment, techniques, and ingredients. The book's refined design captures the sophistication and chic decadence of Giselle's beloved bake shop.",

        "description": "From Tom Colicchio, chef/co-owner of New York\u2019s acclaimed Gramercy Tavern, comes a book that profiles the food and philosophy of Craft, his unique restaurant in the heart of New York\u2019s Flatiron district, and winner of the 2002 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant in America. From its food to its architecture and menu design, Craft has been celebrated for its courageous movement away from culinary theatrics and over-the-top presentations, back to the simple magic of great food. Realizing that his own culinary style had grown increasingly unembellished, and gambling that New York diners were experiencing that same kind of culinary fatigue (brought on by too much \u201cfancy food\u201d), Colicchio set out to prove that the finest food didn\u2019t have to be the most complicated. From its opening in March 2001, Craft offered diners simple, soulful dishes centered around single ingredients that went on to shake up many people\u2019s ideas of what \u201crestaurant food\u201d should be like.Craft of Cooking leads you through Colicchio\u2019s thought process in choosing raw materials\u2014like what to look for in fresh fish, or how to choose the perfect mushroom\u2014to show that good food is available to anyone with access to a good supermarket, farm stand, or gourmet grocery. The book also features \u201cDay-in-the-Life-of-Craft\u201d portraits, which offer a fascinating, behind-the-scenes glimpse at areas of the restaurant beyond the dining room. These segments allow the reader to peer into the fast-paced prep kitchen, to witness the high drama of reservations, and to get a taste of the humor and empathy necessary to serve New York\u2019s colorful visitors and foodies.And then there are the recipes. Craft of Cooking presents 140 recipes that range from the simplest dish of spring peas to roasted fish; from lush but effortless braises to complex brining and curing of meat for homemade charcuterie, included to give the reader a \u201cfly-on-the-wall\u201d experience of visiting the Craft kitchen for themselves. Dishes are divided\u2013like the Craft menu itself\u2013into categories of meat, fish, vegetables, potatoes, grains, desserts, and pantry, and then further delineated by technique\u2013roasting, braising, saut\u00e9ing, etc.\u2013with abundant suggestions and technical tips. Using Tom\u2019s straightforward and friendly voice, Craft of Cooking offers recipes suited to any purpose\u2014from a quick family meal to a festive dinner party for twelve.As he did in his James Beard award-winning book, Think Like a Chef, Colicchio uses Craft of Cooking to teach, tell his story, and offer inspiration to cooks of any skill level. With more than 100 full-color and black-and-white photographs, Craft of Cooking is destined to become a staple of home cooks everywhere\u2014the one \u201crestaurant cookbook\u201d they can\u2019t live without.",

When she decided to become a vegan chef, she dreamed of changing the way the world ate. This was in the \u201cpre-kale\u201d days, when veggie burgers were frozen, tasteless patties loathed by the general public and if a vegan wanted to eat, well, then she had to cook! Today, corner stores stock their shelves with almond milk and mainstream restaurants pepper their menus with quinoa, tempeh, chia seeds, faro, ramps, and so many variations of avocado toast. There is truly no better time to love to eat than now\u2014and no easier time to be a vegan.&nbsp;Chloe believes the most delicious dishes come from plant-based ingredients, and has debunked the myth that vegan cooking is bland and visually unenticing. Enter: CHLOE FLAVOR. Every recipe here is bold in taste, loud in color, unabashedly unique, and, above all, easy to make. With dishes like Smoky Grits &amp; Greens, Mango-Guacamole Crunch Burgers, and Sea Salted Chocolate Chunk Cookies, this food is for fun, friends, and family\u2014and it\u2019s all about the flavor. Vegans will delight in Chloe\u2019s creations and carnivores won\u2019t miss the meat one bit.  First breaking onto the culinary scene as the only vegan chef to capture the top prize on Food Network\u2019s Cupcake Wars, Chef Chloe Coscarelli has since been recognized for bringing vegan cuisine to the mainstream as an award-winning chef, successful entrepreneur, and bestselling cookbook author. She has published three bestselling cookbooks, and in 2015 she opened her first restaurant, by CHLOE., bringing healthy and satisfying vegan and plant-based dishes to the masses. She lives in New York City.",

        "description": "Vermont-based master butcher Cole Ward delivers a comprehensive guide to whole-animal butchery that goes beyond conventional \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d books and takes readers inside the world of truly sustainable meat production. The Gourmet Butcher's Guide to Meat demystifies the process of getting meat to the table, and its wide scope will be welcome to those who not only wish to learn the rudiments of butchery, but also want to understand how meat animals are raised, slaughtered, and marketed in a holistic system that honors both animals and consumers.  Written in Cole\u2019s unique voice of humor and simplicity, the book celebrates the traditional art of culinary butchery, introducing readers to stand-out butchers in America and Europe as well as a diverse group of farmers committed to raising the very best animals with respect.  The many methods of raising and finishing meat animals are clearly and thoroughly explained and compared, and sensitive issues like hormone and antibiotic use in meat production are assessed. Readers will learn all the terminology associated with meat and butchery, as well as the complexities of meat grading, carcass yield, marbling scores, and issues with inspection.

History buffs will delight in the chapter that traces the roots of butchery from pre-history to modern times, and meat shoppers will welcome Cole\u2019s description of what goes on behind the scenes at meat markets large and small. And, of course, new or aspiring butchers will find a well-illustrated slideshow on CD (included in the back of the book) with over 800 images on cutting up a side of beef, a side of pork, and whole lamb and chicken in more detail than is offered in any other book on the subject.

Unable to enjoy many of her most favorite foods, she knew she must find a health-sustaining alternative. Thus Sarah started experimenting with sourdough leavening, which almost immediately began to heal her gut and inspire her anew in the kitchen. Soon after, her artisan small-batch bakery, BK17, was launched, and with that, a new way to savor and share nutritious sourdough breads and treats with her Brooklyn community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sourdough and other fermented foods are making a comeback because of their rich depth of flavor and proven health benefits. In Sourdough, Sarah demystifies keeping a sourdough culture, which is an extended fermentation process that allows for maximum flavor and easy digestion, showing us just how simple it can be to create a healthy starter from scratch. Moreover, Sarah uses home-grown sourdough starter in dozens of baked goods, including cookies, cakes, scones, flatbreads, tarts, and more--well beyond bread. Sarah is a botanist and gardener as well as a baker--her original recipes are accented with brief natural history notes of the highlighted plants and ingredients used therein. Anecdotes from the garden will delight naturalists and baked-goods lovers among us. Laced with botanical and cultural notes on grains, fruits and vegetables, herbs, and even weeds, Sourdough&nbsp;celebrates seasonal abundance alongside the timeless craft of artisan baking.",

It can be mentally and emotionally exhausting to feel deprived of all the juicy processed foods, so this diet definitely isn\u2019t for beginners. Another challenge is adapting this kind of diet to your lifestyle while still keeping its core tenets intact. As soon as you start a Keto vegetarian diet, you\u2019ll realize why Carbs are so popular: they\u2019re easy to make, handle transport well and taste great. So, unless you have your logistics down to a science, you\u2019ll find it very difficult to maintain a Keto vegetarian diet, but you should try it nonetheless and keep trying until you make it. Eating fewer carbs and more fat lowers insulin, which is responsible for fat storage. By maintaining low insulin in your blood, the body slowly starts to spend its fat reserves and enters a state known as \u201cketosis\u201d. There are several stages of ketosis, but what you want to aim for is called \u201coptimal ketosis\u201d. To measure your ketosis, you need a specialized gadget for measuring ketone blood levels.

More than thirty-four of the fifty United States, plus many Canadian regions, have cities and towns at altitudes of more than 2,500 feet, yet there are hardly any cookbooks that address the special needs of these local bakers. Until now. Award-winning cookbook author Susan G. Purdy has finally written the first-ever foolproof guide to high-altitude baking.Purdy has actually \"gone there and done that,\" staying as long as it took to bake these recipes to perfection at five different locations -- and elevations -- across thecountry. In Pie in the Sky, Purdy leaves behind old conversion tables, disproves many oft-repeated calculations and adjustments, and presents reliable recipes in their entirety for each altitude. She takes out the tinkering and guarantees success at any height.In addition, she explains the hows and whys, gives tips and hints for problems specific to every altitude, and generally demystifies the subject of atmospheric obstacles that cause favorite recipes to flop. Whether they live in the eastern mountains or the far west, in Boston, Massachusetts; Boone, North Carolina; or Santa Fe, New Mexico; home bakers as well as experienced chefs will love the wide range of easy-to-make treats including Mile-High Lemon Meringue Pie, Coconut Cake with Coconut Icing, Paradise Peak Chocolate Souffl\u00e9, Vail Lemon-Poppy Seed Loaf, Celestial Challah, and Sour Cream Streusel Coffee Cake.Every recipe was tested at sea level (Connecticut), 3,000 feet (North Carolina and Virginia), 5,000 feet (Idaho and Colorado), 7,000 feet (New Mexico), and 10,000 feet (Colorado) and can be used at these elevations or any points in between.",

There are three basic methods for making bread\u2026 - Knead by hand\u2026 the most common method. - Bread machine\u2026 very popular, but your loaf will have a silly little paddle in the bottom. - No-knead\u2026 a method in which Mother Nature does the kneading for you. This cookbook uses the \u201cno-knead\u201d method. The advantages are\u2026 - No kneading\u2026 Mother Nature does the kneading for you. - No yeast proofing\u2026 instant yeast doesn\u2019t require proofing. - No special equipment (no mixer, no bread machine)\u2026 entire process is done in a glass bowl with a spoon and spatula, and can be baked in a wide variety of baking vessels (bread pan, uncovered baker, skillet, preheated Dutch oven, etc.). - Only 4 ingredients (flour, salt, yeast and water)\u2026 to which other ingredients can be added to make a variety of specialty breads. There are two methods for making no-knead bread\u2026 - Traditional\u2026 proofs for 8 to 24 hours. - \u201cTurbo\u201d\u2026 ready to bake in 2-1/2 hours. This cookbook will start by teaching you how to make no-knead bread using the traditional method, then \u201cTurbo\u201d method, because the traditional method is more popular and a little easier. No-knead bread can be bake in a variety of baking vessels\u2026 - Bread pan\u2026 the #1 baking vessel for bread - Dutch oven\u2026 ideal for baking a round loaf (boule) - Long covered baker\u2026 ideal for baking half loaves and long loaves. - Poor man\u2019s Dutch oven\u2026 combines the ease of baking in a bread pan with the principles of baking in a Dutch oven. This cookbook starts by showing you how to bake no-knead bread in a bread pan\u2026 it\u2019s easy and safer than working with a hot Dutch oven. Then we will expand our use of baking vessels to include the Dutch oven, covered baker, and \u201cpoor man\u2019s Dutch oven\u201d (PMDO). And we won\u2019t stop there. This cookbook will also show you how to make rolls, pizza, and pretzels.. - Rolls\u2026 you\u2019ll learn how to use bakeware to shape the rolls for you. - Pizza\u2026 you\u2019ll learn how to make you own pizza dough. - Pretzels\u2026 add one step to the process and you\u2019ll have pretzels. What makes this cookbook different from others is\u2026 - \u201cHands-free technique\u201d\u2026 a new and innovative technique that uses the handle end of a plastic spoon to manipulate the dough (like a dough hook) after which the dough goes straight from the mixing bowl to the baking vessel (bread pan, etc.) without dusting the work surface with flour or touching the dough with your hands. - \u201cRoll-to-coat\u201d\u2026 an innovative technique that coats the dough ball with flour in the mixing bowl. No more sticky dough. When the dough comes out of the bowl it will be easy to handle if you wish to divide the dough into portion to make baguettes, rolls, etc. - \u201cPoor man\u2019s Dutch oven\u201d\u2026 new and innovative technique which combines the ease of baking in a bread pan with the principles of baking in a Dutch oven. The cookbook also includes sections that will help you understand ingredients, technique, and bakeware. In others words, I start with the simplest recipe, then add one technique or method until you\u2019re a master baker. Step by step, this cookbook will take you on a journey you will love and enjoy.

        "description": "From the acclaimed chef and owner of Brooklyn Delhi, a debut cookbook focused on the celebrated vegetarian fare of South India. &nbsp; Lifelong vegetarian and chef Chitra Agrawal takes you on an epicurean journey to her mother\u2019s hometown of Bangalore and back to Brooklyn, where she adapts her family\u2019s South Indian recipes for home cooks. This particular style of Indian home cooking, often called the \u201cyoga diet,\u201d is light and fresh, yet satisfying and rich in bold and complex flavors. Grains, legumes, fresh produce, coconut, and yogurt\u2014along with herbs, citrus, chiles, and spices\u2014form the cornerstone of this delectable cuisine, rooted in vegetarian customs and honed over centuries for optimum taste and nutrition.&nbsp;  &nbsp; From the classic savory crepe dosa, filled with lemony turmeric potatoes and cilantro coconut chutney, to new creations like coconut polenta topped with spring vegetables 'upma\" and homemade yogurt, the recipes in Vibrant India are simple to prepare and a true celebration of color and flavor on a plate. Chitra weaves together the historical context behind the region\u2019s cuisine and how she brought some of these age-old traditions to life thousands of miles away in Brooklyn during the city\u2019s exciting food renaissance.  Relying on her experience as a culinary instructor, Chitra introduces the essential Indian cooking techniques, tips, and ingredients you\u2019ll need to prepare a full range of recipes from quick vegetable stir frys (corn, basil, and leeks flavored with butter, cumin, and black pepper), salads (citrus red cabbage and fennel slaw with black mustard seeds, curry leaves, and chile), yogurt raitas (shredded beets and coconut in yogurt), and chutneys and pickles (preserved Meyer lemon in chile brine) to hearty stews (aromatic black eyed peas, lentils, and greens), coconut curries (summer squash in an herby coconut yogurt sauce), and fragrant rice dishes (lime dill rice with pistachios). Rounding out the book is an array of addictive snacks (popcorn topped with curry leaf butter), creative desserts (banana, coconut, and cardamom ice cream), and refreshing drinks (chile watermelon juice with mint). Chitra provides numerous substitutions to accommodate produce seasonality, ingredient availability, and personal tastes. The majority of recipes are gluten-free and vegan or can be easily modified to adhere to those dietary restrictions. Whether you are a vegetarian or just looking for ways to incorporate more vegetarian recipes into your repertoire, Vibrant India is a practical guide for bringing delicious Indian home cooking to your table on a regular basis.",

Growing up as the sensitive, slightly awkward child of three in a race-conscious space, she decided early on that she\u2019d rather spend her time eating cookies and honey buns than taking on the weight of worldly issues. It helped her see that good food is the most powerful way to connect, understand and heal. Inspired by this realization, each one of her recipes tells a story. Orange Peel Pound Cake brings back memories of summer days eating Florida oranges at Big Ma\u2019s house, Rosketti cookies reimagine the treats her mother ate growing up in Guam, and Plaited Dukkah Bread parallels the braids worked into her hair as a child. Jerrelle leads you on a sensual baking journey using the five senses, retelling and reinventing food memories while using ingredients that make her feel more in control and more connected to the world and the person she has become. Whole flours, less refined sugar and vegan alternatives make it easier to celebrate those sweet moments that made her who she is today.

The culmination of more than fifty years of living, traveling, and cooking in Mexico, The Art of Mexican Cooking is the ultimate guide to creating authentic Mexican food in your own kitchen, with more than 200 beloved recipes as well as evocative illustrations.The dishes included, favorites from all the regions of Mexico, range from sophisticated to pure and simple, but they all share an intrinsic depth of taste. Aficionados will go to great lengths to duplicate the authentic dishes (and Kennedy tells them exactly how), but here too is a wealth of less complicated recipes for the casual cook in search of the unmistakable flavors of a bold cuisine.Kennedy shares the secrets of true Mexican flavor: balancing the piquant taste of chiles with a little salt and acid, for instance, or charring them to round out their flavor; broiling tomatoes to bring out their character, or adding cumin for a light accent. By using Kennedy\u2019s kitchen wisdom and advice, and carefully selecting produce that is now readily available in most American markets, cooks with an appetite for Mexican cuisine\u2013and Kennedy devotees old and new\u2013can at last serve and enjoy real Mexican food.\u201cThis is the ultimate in Mexican cooking from the world\u2019s leading authority.\u201d \u2014Paula Wolfert, author of The Cooking of South-West France",

Covering the full spectrum of chocolate work--from the fundamentals of chocolate making to instruction on advanced showpiece design and assembly--The Art of the Chocolatier is the most complete and comprehensive guide to chocolate making on the market. The book covers basic information on ingredients, equipment, and common techniques in the pastry kitchen, while also offering clear, step-by-step instructions on creating small candies and large-scale chocolate pieces. This is the ideal book for pastry students enrolled in chocolate and confectionery courses, as well as working professionals and even serious home confectioners who want to improve their skills in advanced chocolate work.  Illustrated step-by-step instructions cover all the essentials of chocolate-making, from tempering and creating ganache and gianduja to using molds, transfer sheets, and more. An entire chapter devoted to Creating a Competition Piece covers the ins and outs of confectionery competition, from preparing for the event and developing a concept to designing and building a winning chocolate showpiece. Beautiful full-color photos throughout provide inspiration for chocolate d\u00e9cor and showpiece design, while clear how-to photos illustrate key techniques.  The Art of the Chocolatier provides expert-level coverage of every aspect of the chocolatier's art for students and professionals alike.  Selected Recipes from The Art of the Chocolatier Chocolate Shavings  Chocolate shavings can be used as a d\u00e9cor element for showpieces, and they are useful for hiding imperfections. They are often used to surround flowers instead of leaves. They can be made from any type or color of chocolate.  Spread a thin layer of tempered chocolate directly onto a marble with an offset spatula. Clean the edges with a triangle spatula to form a sharp rectangle.  Once the chocolate sets, rub your hand over it to warm it and to increase elasticity.  Use a triangle scraper to shave off the chocolate in a fast, curving outward motion.  NOTE: White chocolate sets more slowly than dark chocolate, allowing more time to shave it off as compared to the dark chocolate.           Variation Marbled Chocolate Shavings: Drizzle dark chocolate onto a marble tabletop, and before it sets, cover with white chocolate, slightly blending them together to create a marbled look. Use an offset spatula to spread the marbled chocolates into a thin layer. Shave off curls as described above.             Flower Vase Showpiece          Clockwise from left on diagram: Leaves, sphere, flower support, circular base for beneath vase, feet, base, support for pralines.

Growing up in an all-women household and coddled endlessly by his Italian mother and grandmother, Eric Lindstrom was nourished to obesity on meaty sauces, fried eggs, and butter-laden cookies. After spending the first half of his life as an adamant omnivore, Lindstrom went 100% vegan. Reluctantly. Overnight. From burgers to beets, from pork to parsnips. It\u2019s time for a down-to-earth book that proves anyone can go vegan (even someone who once ate sixty-eight chicken wings in a sitting). How can a man adopt a vegan approach? Won\u2019t he die of protein deficiency? What if he is married to a vegan woman? How would he order a salad at a Minnesota steakhouse? What should he bring to a gluten-free, nut-free, macrobiotic, nightshade-free, oil-free, vegan potluck (true story)? Part confession and part survival guide, The Skeptical Vegan explains how simple it really is to be vegan, covering topics from food and nutrition to social challenges and lifestyle. Snarky, witty, and opinionated to a fault, Lindstrom speaks as a male vegan, contesting the notion that \u201creal men\u201d should only eat meat. With twenty original \u201cveganized\u201d recipes including portobello steaks, carrot hot dogs, tofu wings, \u201cmeaty\u201d chili, and cauliflower bites (which helped him shed thirty pounds), Lindstrom demonstrates how to take control of your diet while still eating \u201cmeatily\u201d and taking into account the ethical considerations of living a better life for the animals, the environment, and yourself.",

When her dad took too long to make dinner every night, she started doing the cooking\u2014at age 15. Ever-determined to reign in the chaos of her big family, Tieghan found her place in the kitchen. She had a knack for creating unique dishes, which led her to launch her blog, Half Baked Harvest. Since then, millions of people have fallen in love with her fresh take on comfort food, stunning photography, and charming life in the mountains.  &nbsp; While it might be a trek to get to Tieghan\u2019s barn-turned-test kitchen, her creativity shines here: dress up that cheese board with a real honey comb; decorate a standard salad with spicy, crispy sweet potato fries; serve stir fry over forbidden black rice; give French Onion Soup an Irish kick with Guinness and soda bread; bake a secret ingredient into your apple pie (hint: it\u2019s molasses).

        "description": "New York Times\u2019 best-selling author, Gary Null, Ph.D., with more than 70 titles to his name and nearly 40 million books sold to date offers this complete guide to becoming a successful and truly healthy vegetarian. In his characteristically engaging and matter-of-fact style, Dr. Null not only forwards a brilliant and thorough discussion on the importance of the vegetarian diet and how to be successful at it, but an in-depth understanding of the foundational spiritual practices of the lifestyle and their importance to both personal and planetary health. While studies now show that just shy of 10% of the U.S. population are vegetarians or have a vegetarian-inclined diet, there are a whole host that try and fail. Add to this, the percentage of self-proclaimed vegetarians that do not eat well, relying on a host of non-animal-based junk foods for \u201cnourishment,\u201d and we have a tragedy on our hands, states Dr. Null. \u201cThis is especially troublesome when we have an abundance of professional support for these folks along with scientific proof that the plant-based diet not only significantly reduces but eradicates most every known lifestyle disease,\u201d he exclaims. In fact, there is a broad movement toward healthier eating in America, and the statistics bear out reason; the leading killers of Americans continue to be non-infectious lifestyle-related diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung diseases. About 600,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year\u2013that's 1 in every 4 deaths. Currently, cancer is running almost equal to heart disease and climbing, and we are still contending with historically unprecedented levels of obesity and diabetes. \u201cWhy, then,\u201d Dr. Null queries, \u201caren\u2019t more people choosing the vegetarian lifestyle and succeeding at it?\u201d &nbsp;   The Healthy Vegetarian: Healing Yourself, Healing Our Planet provides an in-depth exploration of historical and modern-day vegetarianism with concrete evidence on the health-debilitating, environmentally-degrading effects of our nation\u2019s meat and dairy-based diet. It also expertly addresses the numerous psychological, emotional, societal, economic and political roadblocks that American\u2019s face in the endeavor to become a healthy vegetarian. &nbsp; &nbsp; From the lack of educational support for vegetarianism, to special interest food industry groups, to the biggest myth of all\u2015the protein myth\u2015perpetrated across the media wires today by naysayers, Dr. Null single-handedly demystifies vegetarianism and tells us precisely what it takes to succeed at this very significant lifestyle choice. A choice, he notes, that is ultimately crucial for humanity\u2019s survival. &nbsp;Perhaps the most enlightening, potentially life-altering aspect of this important offering, Dr. Null summons readers to consider their dietary and lifestyle choices in the larger format of spiritual integrity, noting: There has to be a reason that vegetarianism has been integral to most of the world\u2019s great religions. The answer, he asserts, is the foundational practice of reverence for all of life, which taps into the true nature of being human, which is a power that can heal our world. &nbsp; Could it be then, he asks, that the vast majority of problems we are experiencing today with our health and in our personal lives as well as in the world are a result of our disconnection with our true nature\u2015a disconnection that could all but be eliminated by the choice of a vegetarian lifestyle? Join us and discover the amazing truths within this book that are waiting to be revealed\u2026truths that will not only help you become the healthiest possible vegetarian, but the healthiest possible human.",

Completely updating it for the first time since 1979, Marion Cunningham made Fannie Farmer once again a household word for a new generation of cooks.What makes this basic cookbook so distinctive is that Marion Cunningham, who is the personification of the nineteenth-century teacher, is always at your side with her forthright tips and comments, encouraging the beginning cook and inspiring the more adventurous. She knows what today's cooks are looking for, and she has a way of instilling confidence and joy in the act of cooking.In giving the book new life, Mrs. Cunningham has been careful always to preserve the best of the old. She has retained all the particularly good, tried-and-true recipes from preceding editions, retesting and rewriting when necessary. She has rediscovered lost treasures, including delicious recipes that were eliminated when practically no one baked bread at home. This is now the place to find the finest possible recipes for Pumpkin Soup, Boston Baked Beans, Carpetbag Steak, Roast Stuffed Turkey, Anadama Bread, Indian Pudding, Apple Pie, and all of the other traditional favorites.The new recipes reflect ethnic influences\u2014Mediterranean, Moroccan, Asian\u2014that have been adding their flavors to American cooking in recent years. Tucked in among all your favorites like Old-Fashioned Beef Stew, New England Clam Chowder, Ham Timbales, and Chicken Jambalaya, you'll find her cool Cucumber Sushi, Enchiladas with Chicken and Green Sauce, or a layered dish of Polenta and Fish to add variety to your repertoire. Always a champion of old-fashioned breakfasts and delectable desserts, Mrs. Cunningham has many splendid new offerings to tempt you. Throughout, cooking terms and procedures are explained, essential ingredients are spelled out, basic equipment is assessed. Mrs. Cunningham even tells you how to make a good cup of coffee and how to brew tea properly. For the diet-conscious, there is an expanded nutritional chart that includes a breakdown of cholesterol and fat in common ingredients as well as in Fannie Farmer basic recipes. Where the taste of a dish would not be altered, Mrs. Cunningham has reduced the amount of cream and butter in some of the recipes from the preceding edition. She carefully evaluates the issues of food safety today and alerts us to potential hazards.But the emphasis here is always on good flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of variety in one's daily fare, which Marion Cunningham believes is the secret to a healthy diet. Dedicated to the home cooks of America, young and old, this thirteenth edition of the book that won the hearts of Americans more than a century ago invites us all\u2014as did the original Fannie Farmer\u2014to cherish the delights of the family table.",

        "description": "A must-have guide to chocolate making and chocolate showpiece design, from renowned confectionery expert Ewald Notter. Covering the full spectrum of chocolate work--from the fundamentals of chocolate making to instruction on advanced showpiece design and assembly--The Art of the Chocolatier is the most complete and comprehensive guide to chocolate making on the market. The book covers basic information on ingredients, equipment, and common techniques in the pastry kitchen, while also offering clear, step-by-step instructions on creating small candies and large-scale chocolate pieces. This is the ideal book for pastry students enrolled in chocolate and confectionery courses, as well as working professionals and even serious home confectioners who want to improve their skills in advanced chocolate work.  Illustrated step-by-step instructions cover all the essentials of chocolate-making, from tempering and creating ganache and gianduja to using molds, transfer sheets, and more. An entire chapter devoted to Creating a Competition Piece covers the ins and outs of confectionery competition, from preparing for the event and developing a concept to designing and building a winning chocolate showpiece. Beautiful full-color photos throughout provide inspiration for chocolate d\u00e9cor and showpiece design, while clear how-to photos illustrate key techniques.  The Art of the Chocolatier provides expert-level coverage of every aspect of the chocolatier's art for students and professionals alike.  Selected Recipes from The Art of the Chocolatier Chocolate Shavings  Chocolate shavings can be used as a d\u00e9cor element for showpieces, and they are useful for hiding imperfections. They are often used to surround flowers instead of leaves. They can be made from any type or color of chocolate.  Spread a thin layer of tempered chocolate directly onto a marble with an offset spatula. Clean the edges with a triangle spatula to form a sharp rectangle.  Once the chocolate sets, rub your hand over it to warm it and to increase elasticity.  Use a triangle scraper to shave off the chocolate in a fast, curving outward motion.  NOTE: White chocolate sets more slowly than dark chocolate, allowing more time to shave it off as compared to the dark chocolate.

By deconstructing age-old techniques and reducing the number of steps in a recipe, as well as helping us to understand the nature of each spice and seasoning, she enables us to make seemingly exotic Indian dishes part of our everyday cooking.\u2022 First, she tantalizes us with bite-size delights to snack on with drinks or tea.\u2022 A silky soup is mellowed with coconut milk; a spinach-and-ginger soup is perfumed with cloves.\u2022 Fish and seafood are transformed by simple rubs and sauces and new ways of cooking.\u2022 A lover of eggs and chicken dishes, Jaffrey offers fresh and easy ways to cook them, including her favorite masala omelet and simple poached eggs over vegetables.

Here are the dishes she grew up on in India and then shared with her own family and friends in America. And now that she has made them so accessible to us, we can incorporate them confidently into our own kitchen, and enjoy the spice and variety and health-giving properties of this delectable cuisine.",

This funny, inspirational story shows how families really do come in all shapes and sizes. In the summer of 2012, Steve Jenkins was contacted by an old friend about adopting a micro piglet. Though he knew his partner Derek wouldn't be enthusiastic, he agreed to take the adorable little pig anyway, thinking he could care for her himself. Little did he know, that decision would change his and Derek's lives forever.  It turned out there was nothing \"micro\" about Esther, and Steve and Derek had actually signed on to raise a full-sized commercial pig. Within three years, Tiny Esther grew to a whopping 600 pounds. After some real growing pains and a lot of pig-sized messes, it became clear that Esther needed much more space, so Steve and Derek made another life-changing decision: they bought a farm and opened the Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary, where they could care for Esther and other animals in need.  Funny, heartwarming, and utterly charming, ESTHER THE WONDER PIG follows Steve and Derek's adventure--from reluctant pig parents to farm-owning advocates for animals.  ",

To make vegetables delicious, to make them irresistible, to come up with a whole bunch of recipes that are easy, family-friendly, and just make it that much easier to put a load of veg into your diet every single day.' Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall Hugh's River Cottage Veg Every Day! became the UK's best-selling vegetable cookbook, persuading us through sheer temptation to make vegetables the mainstay of our daily cooking. In this much-anticipated follow-up, Hugh delivers more irresistible recipes, and this time, takes things one step further. Fuelled by his passionate belief that plant foods should be the dominant force in our kitchens, Hugh has put cheese, butter, cream, eggs, and refined flour and sugar firmly to one side. Instead, he uses veg, fruit, wholegrains, nuts, seeds, spices and cold-pressed oils to explore the length and breadth of what can be achieved with natural, unprocessed plant foods. River Cottage Much More Veg! makes it clear that unadulterated ingredients are the very best building blocks for delicious and healthy meals. In typical Hugh style, the recipes are easy, utterly foolproof and delicious. All but a handful are gluten-free, and at least half the dishes require 20 minutes (or less) hands-on work time. With recipes such as Roast squash and chickpeas with spicy apricot sauce, Blackened cauliflower with pecans and tahini, Spiced beetroot, radicchio and orange traybake, Celeriac and seaweed miso broth, Seared summer cabbage with rosemary, chilli and capers, and Baked celery agrodolce, River Cottage Much More Veg! demonstrates how easy it is to make versatile, plentiful and delicious vegetables the bedrock of your diet.",

The Allergen-Free Baker\u2019s Handbook features 100 tried-and-true recipes that are completely free of all ingredients responsible for 90 percent of food allergies, sparing bakers the all-too-common frustration of having to make unsatisfactory substitutions or rework recipes entirely. To make things even easier, energized and empathetic mom Cybele Pascal demystifies alternative foodstuffs and offers an insider\u2019s advice about choosing safe products and sources for buying them. As the head baker for a food-allergic family, food writer Pascal shares her most in-demand treats and how to make them work without allergenic ingredients. Her collection includes a delightfully familiar array of sweets and savory goodies that are no longer off-limits, from Glazed Vanilla Scones, Cinnamon Rolls, and Lemon-Lime Squares to Chocolate Fudge Brownies, Red Velvet Cake, and every kid\u2019s favorite: Pizza. In addition to being a lifeline for people with food allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances, these entirely vegan recipes are perfect for anyone looking to avoid artificial and refined ingredients, and those interested in baking with healthful new gluten-free flours such as quinoa, sorghum, and amaranth. Best of all, Pascal has fine-tuned each recipe to please the palates of the most exacting critics: her young sons. Lennon and Monte like these tasty treats even better than their traditional counterparts, and you will too!",

Her earlier cookbook, Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow-Cooker, established her bona fides as an expert on the creative use of slow-cookers, and her entire body of work speaks to her ingenuity in the kitchen and the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker provides practical guidence on how to work with different models of slow-cookers, taking into account the sizes of various machines, the variety of settings they offer, and the quirks and personalities of each device. She addresses any lingering skepticism readers may have about whether slow-cookers can have delicious, meat-free applications, and she shows how to take into account the water content of vegetables and the absorptive qualities of grains when vegan slow-cooking. Fresh from the Vegan Slow-Cooker includes eleven recipe chapters, four of which focus on main courses. There are homey and comforting foods in the American and European style, such as a Rustic Pot Pie Topped with Chive Biscuits and a Ziti with Mushroom and Bell Pepper Ragu, and there are lots of East Asian, South and Southeast Asian, and Mexican/Latin dishes, too. Beans, which cook slowly under any circumstance, are fabulously well-suited to the slow cooker, and Robertson includes such appealing recipes as a Crockery Cassoulet and a Greek-Style Beans with Tomatoes and Spinach. Eighteen robust chilis and stews - two more categories that do well in the slow-cooker - include a warming Chipotle Black Bean Chili with Winter Squash and a surprising but yummy Seitan Stroganoff. Beyond the mains, there are chapters devoted to snacks and appetizers, desserts, breads and breakfasts, and even one on drinks. The many soy-free and gluten-free recipes are clearly identified. Altogether, the collection offers readers loads of ways to expand their vegan repertoire and to get maximum value from their investment in a slow-cooker.",

        "description": "Meat eating is often a contentious subject, whether considering the technical, ethical, environmental, political, or health-related aspects of production and consumption. This book is a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination and critique of meat consumption by humans, throughout their evolution and around the world. Setting the scene with a chapter on meat\u2019s role in human evolution and its growing influence during the development of agricultural practices, the book goes on to examine modern production systems, their efficiencies, outputs, and impacts. The major global trends of meat consumption are described in order to find out what part its consumption plays in changing modern diets in countries around the world. The heart of the book addresses the consequences of the \"massive carnivory\" of western diets, looking at the inefficiencies of production and at the huge impacts on land, water, and the atmosphere. Health impacts are also covered, both positive and negative. In conclusion, the author looks forward at his vision of \u201crational meat eating\u201d, where environmental and health impacts are reduced, animals are treated more humanely, and alternative sources of protein make a higher contribution. Should We Eat Meat? is not an ideological tract for or against carnivorousness but rather a careful evaluation of meat's roles in human diets and the environmental and health consequences of its production and consumption. It will be of interest to a wide readership including professionals and academics in food and agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental science, and regulatory and policy making bodies around the world.",

        "description": "We've all seen them in grocery stores and restaurants: delectably juicy, evenly browned, picture-perfect rotisserie chickens. Do you think they look unattainable, like something that can only be bought in a store and never replicated at home? In truth, it's as easy as can be with a rotisserie oven. A small rotisserie oven that fits right on your kitchen counter will effortlessly transform a humble chicken (and so much more) into a gloriously crispy, moist, and delicious family dinner in about an hour (while you are busy doing other things, or maybe even finding time to relax). The rotisserie is one of the most recent additions to the kitchen-appliance repertoire. What you may not realize is that it's also one of the most versatile and user-friendly. It can cook everything from meat and poultry to vegetable side dishes and desserts; it works without heating up he rest of the kitchen like an over; it's compact enough to occupy only a small amount of valuable counter space; plus, it's easy to clean! In The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook, Diane Phillips creatively takes the rotisserie oven well beyond chicken to every kind of food and every course of the meal. Go on, give it a whirl with recipes such as Calypso Jerk Chicken Kabobs, Roasted Garlic Prime Rib Roast, Plum Crazy Pork Chops, or Roasted Salmon with Mustard Chive Butter. Since the rotisserie bastes food in its own juices and allows excess fat to drain away, everything cooks up lighter and healthier than the same food that is cooked in the traditional oven or stovetop manner. For easy, no-fuss hors d'oeuvres or side dishes, try Blue Bayou Stuffed Mushrooms, Sugar Cane Shrimp, No-Fry Pommes Frites, or Pesto-Grilled Eggplant. With an extensive chapter of marinades, sauces, and rubs to spice things up or cool them down (how about Southwestern Fiesta Rib Sauce or Cucumber Mint Salsa?) and one on desserts to sweeten the deal (ever thought of making Rotisserie Caramel Apples or Fire-Roasted Pineapple with Macadamia Caramel Sauce?), your possibilities are limitless. The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook is, simply, the be-all and end-all book for the rotisserie oven, with 300 recipes for every possible way you could think of to use this amazing machine.",

        "description": "At the French Culinary Institute, Lauren Shockey learned to salt food properly, cook fearlessly over high heat, and knock back beers like a pro. But she also discovered that her real culinary education wouldn't begin until she actually worked in a restaurant. After a somewhat disappointing apprenticeship in the French provinces, Shockey hatched a plan for her dream year: to apprentice in four high-end restaurants around the world. She started in her hometown of New York City under the famed chef Wylie Dufresne at the molecular gastronomy hotspot wd-50, then traveled to Vietnam, Israel, and back to France. From the ribald kitchen humor to fiery-tempered workers to tasks ranging from the mundane (mincing cases of shallots) to the extraordinary (cooking seafood on the line), Shockey shows us what really happens behind the scenes in haute cuisine, and includes original recipes integrating the techniques and flavors she learned along the way. With the dramatic backdrop of restaurant life, readers will be delighted by the adventures of a bright and restless young woman looking for her place in the world.    ",

The region is also a popular real-estate mecca for retirees and vacation home buyers. These factors, combined with the local food movement that has grown up around the cultural communities in Asheville, Boone, and Blowing Rock, are a welcoming environment for fine dining and an irresistible attraction for a number of remarkable chefs. Chefs of the Mountains: Restaurants and Recipes from Western North Carolina provides a guide to finding these culinary gems plus the tools to re-create favorite dining experiences in the home.

Each profile also includes: a description of the restaurant, its ambience, and sample menu items; color photographs of the chefs, restaurants, and food; and recipes from each chef\u2015such as Fried Green Tomatoes, Chocolate Steak, Prosciutto-Stuffed Pork Chop, Grilled Bison, Cornmeal-Crusted Trout, Jicama-Crusted Mahi-Mahi, Shrimp and Grits, Blueberry Semi Freddo, and Avocado-Jalapeno Ice Cream\u2015formatted and tested for home cooks. In addition, sidebars throughout the book offer information about farms (mostly organic) that sell vegetables and meats to the public as well as to restaurants, unique producers from the region (including two 10-year-old boys who have been completely running their own egg production and sales facility since ages 7 and 8), and stories of a number of people who gave up successful careers in order to return to the land. John Batchelor has been writing about restaurants and travel since 1981. He is the restaurant reviewer for the Greensboro News and Record and the Winston-Salem Journal.

Missy Robbins had been on an upward trajectory through the ranks of chefdom, racking up accolades in Chicago at Spiaggia and in New York as the executive chef of A Voce Madison and A Voce Columbus, both of which earned Michelin stars under her leadership. But success in the grueling world of restaurant cooking took a toll, in sacrifices of time, health, and relationships. So in 2013 Robbins hung up the title of executive chef to explore life outside of the restaurant. This book is a result of that year off: A collection of recipes that Robbins created in her tiny West Village kitchen while she rediscovered life outside of the restaurant world. These dishes, organized around essays narrating her year off, will help readers fall in love with cooking again, as Robbins did. In addition to pasta and the Italian-inspired dishes that Robbins is known for, there are her childhood favorites, such as chicken soup with ricotta dumplings, and breakfast, vegetable, and salad recipes, resulting from Robbins\u2019s commitment to healthier eating habits; there is also a chapter of Asian recipes, inspired by a long-wished-for trip to Vietnam and Thailand.

        "description": "Vegan books have risen to a dominant sales position in the vegetarian category. One-dish meals are perennially popular on American tables, and books devoted to one-dish cooking perform well. Robin Robertson's One-Dish Vegan is the first book at the intersection of these two powerful cookbook categories. Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of very successful titles in the vegetarian category. She is known for her creativity in the kitchen, for the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works, and for her expertise in vegetarian nutrition - with a special focus lately on how vegans still can get enough protein in their diets. Typically, it takes two or three courses or dishes to make a well-rounded vegan meal. To meet this criterion in one dish takes the kind of ingenuity and expert knowledge that Robertson possesses. One-Dish Vegan contains more than 150 recipes. They range from the most popular categories of one-dish dining like stews, chilis, and casseroles (and other baked dishes) to a host of stovetop saut\u00c3\u00a9s and stir-fries as well as substantial salads and dishes that feature pasta as well as other noodles, such as Asian noodles. The recipes are at once homey and adventuresome, comforting and surprising. Above all, they demonstrate that it really is possible to get a complete vegan meal into one dish, full of good-for-you nutrients and bright, satisfying flavors.",

        "description": "In The Kind Diet, actress, activist, and committed conservationist Alicia Silverstone shares the insights that encouraged her to swear off meat and dairy forever, and outlines the spectacular benefits of adopting a plant-based diet, from effortless weight loss to clear skin, off-the-chart energy, and smooth digestion. She explains how meat, fish, milk, and cheese\u2015the very foods we've been taught to regard as the cornerstone of good nutrition\u2015are actually the culprits behind escalating rates of disease and the cause of dire, potentially permanent damage to our ecology. Yet going meat- and dairy-free doesn't mean suffering deprivation; to the contrary, The Kind Diet introduces irresistibly delicious food that satisfies on every level\u2015it even includes amazing desserts to keep the most stubborn sweet tooth happy. Alicia also addresses the nutritional concerns faced by many who are new to a plant-based diet, and shows how to cover every nutritional base, from protein to calcium and beyond. Alicia knows that changing life-long dietary habits is a process, and that each person progresses at a different pace. For that reason, The Kind Diet encompasses 3 separate levels, from Flirting to Superhero. Flirts learn to dip a toe into the vegan pool, reducing their meat-eating and swapping out a few key foods for plant-based substitutes to see quickly how even small changes can reap big results. Vegans get to experience the life-altering effects of forgoing animal-products entirely, while still enjoying many convenience foods and meat substitutes in addition to the wonderful grains, vegetables and fruits that form the core of that diet. True enlightenment comes with the Superhero program, based on the principles of macrobiotics and built on a foundation of whole grains, vegetables, and other yummy foods that Alicia describes in detail. Whether your goal is to drop a few pounds, boost your energy and metabolism, or simply save the world, Alicia provides the encouragement, the information, and the tools you need to make the transition to a plant-based diet deliciously empowering.",

        "description": "Charmingly designed and perfectly approachable, here are eighty simple recipes for delicious, healthy food that require nothing more than a mug and a microwave.For anyone who can\u2019t cook, won\u2019t cook, or doesn\u2019t have the time to cook\u2014but still wants a fresh, delicious meal instead of takeout or packaged, processed food when they\u2019re eating alone\u2014here is the answer. All you need for real food, really fast, is a large mug, a microwave, a handful of ingredients, and a spoon. Whether you\u2019re cooking in a pocket-sized apartment, a crowded dorm, or an office kitchenette, here are quick and clever recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, and snacks. Squeezing a home-cooked breakfast into your morning dash is no problem with Peanut Butter and Jam Porridge, Eggs Florentine with Hollandaise, or seed- and fruit-packed Breakfast Muffins. And no more sad office salad: whip up Spicy Lentil and Bacon Soup, Pea and Pesto Soup, and Shrimp Laska in the office kitchen for lunch, with a side of Honeyed Carrots or Garlicky Mushrooms! Chicken Korma, Thai Shrimp Curry, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Chili con Carne, and Sweet Potato and Chickpea Tagine make healthy, quick, and delicious dinners that easily trump overpriced takeout or preservative-laden frozen food. And mug baking is a piece of cake with Chocolate and Pistachio Brownies, White Chocolate and Lime Cheesecake, Berry Crumble, Sticky Gingerbread, and much more. Finally, don\u2019t forget the more conventional (but no less delicious) mug treats: Ultimate Hot Chocolate, Mulled Cider with Ginger, and Vanilla Latte. Yum! You will be in and out of the kitchen, cravings fully satisfied, in five minutes or less!",

        "description": "75 Persian recipes made simple: many requiring only one pot and less than an hour to cook while keeping the authentic flavors of Iran. Includes many vegan and vegetarian options. In Joon, master chef Najmieh Batmanglij distills one of the world's oldest and most influential cuisines to capture its unique flavors in recipes adapted to suit our busy lives. Najmieh's fans have been making meals from her Food of Life for more than 30 years. For Joon she has simplified 75&nbsp;of her favorite dishes and shows how, with the right ingredients and a few basic tools and techniques, authentic Persian food can easily be prepared at home. The recipes in this book--each accompanied by a photograph of the finished dish--come straight from Najmieh's kitchen and include not only the classics of Persian cooking, but also some soon-to-be favorites, such as quinoa or kale cooked Persian-style. You'll discover delicious side dishes, from cooling, yogurt-based salads and tasty dips and spreads, to more sustaining platters of grains, beans and fresh herbs; tasty kukus --frittata-style omelets filled with vegetables and herbs; spice-infused fish; mouth-watering meatballs and kababs served on flat breads with tangy sauces; every kind of rice--including the incomparable polow topped with various sweet and sour braises; not to mention, delightfully aromatic cakes and cookies to round off meals or enjoy as a snack in between. Much of Iran's cuisine is essentially vegetarian. Although kababs are popular restaurant fare, they represent only a small sampling of the dishes Iranians eat at home. Persian cooking, with its emphasis on fresh, natural ingredients corresponds with the trend in eating that's spreading across America. \"Join the delicious revolution!\" as Alice Waters says; \"Eat simply, eat together, eat seasonally, shop at farmers markets.\" Iran and Persia refer to the same place. These days we use \"Iran\" to refer to the country and \"Persia\" or \"Persian\" for the culture, from Persian carpets, and Persian cats to, Persian cooking. Persian, also called farsi, is the language of Iran. Joon means \"life\" in Persian. It can be used in multiple ways, from a term of endearment akin to \"darling\"after someone's name to showing great enthusiasm: \"I love it!\" The expression nush-e joon, literally \"food of life,\" is similar to the French \"bon app\u00e9tit,\" a wish that a meal will be enjoyed.",

        "description": "A unique way of seeing and thinking, and an attention to detail are what shape Chef Janice Wong's inventive desserts - creations applauded by some of the world's most celebrated chefs from French chocolatier-patissier Pierre Herme to Spanish chef-restauranteurs Juan Mari and Elena Arzak. Through this book, the creative mind behind 2am:dessertbar invites you to enter her world. It is a world where beauty is everything, where no detail is too small to appreciate.This is not an ordinary cookbook. It is an exploration of the mind and senses, of perceptions and emotions. The chapters - Origins of Taste, Colours of Taste, Textures of Taste and Memories of Taste - explore the inspirations behind each of her creations, be it the unique, natural flavour of an ingredient, a distinct hue that evokes an emotion, an unexpected texture that jolts the senses, a nostalgic taste that allows the mind to wander back to childhood days. These seemingly disparate sources of inspiration and the creations that stem from them are all threaded by a commonality, a pursuit for perfection in imperfection, and an appreciation of imperfection in perfection. Welcome to Janice Wong's artistic, gastronomic world of flawless imperfection and flawed perfection.",

But this book isn\u2019t just about baking bread-- it\u2019s about what to do with the slices and heels and nubs from those many loaves you\u2019ll bake.&nbsp;Alexandra Stafford grew up eating her mother\u2019s peasant bread at nearly every meal\u2014the recipe for which was a closely-guarded family secret. When her blog, Alexandra\u2019s Kitchen, began to grow in popularity, readers started asking how to make the bread they\u2019d heard so much about; the bread they had seen peeking into photos. Finally, Alexandra\u2019s mother relented, and the recipe went up on the internet. It has since inspired many who had deemed bread-baking an impossibility to give it a try, and their results have exceeded expectations. The secret is in its simplicity: the no-knead dough comes together in fewer than five minutes, rises in an hour, and after a second short rise, bakes in buttered bowls.  &nbsp;After you master the famous peasant bread, you\u2019ll work your way through its many variations, both in flavor (Cornmeal, Jalapeno, and Jack; Three Seed) and form (Cranberry Walnut Dinner Rolls; Cinnamon Sugar Monkey Bread). You\u2019ll enjoy bread\u2019s usual utilities with Food Cart Grilled Cheese and the Summer Tartine with Burrata and Avocado, but then you\u2019ll discover its true versatility when you use it to sop up Mussels with Shallot and White Wine or juicy Roast Chicken Legs. Finally, you\u2019ll find ways to savor every last bite, from Panzanella Salad Three Ways to Roasted Tomato Soup to No-Bake Chocolate-Coconut Cookies.&nbsp;Bread, Toast, Crumbs is a 2018 nominee for&nbsp;The IACP Julia Child First Book Award, and&nbsp;Alexandra's Kitchen was a finalist for the Saveur Blog Awards Most Inspired Weeknight Dinners 2016",

It reveals the rich variety of food Colonial Americans enjoyed, their tastes, cooking and eating habits, even their colorful language.Author Amelia Simmons worked as a domestic in Colonial America and gathered her cookery expertise from firsthand experience. Her book points out the best ways of judging the quality of meats, poultry, fish, vegetables, etc., and presents the best methods of preparing and cooking them. In choosing fish, poultry, and other meats, the author wisely advises, \"their smell denotes their goodness.\" Her sound suggestions for choosing the freshest and most tender onions, potatoes, parsnips, carrots, asparagus, lettuce, cabbage, beans, and other vegetables are as timely today as they were nearly 200 years ago.Here are the first uniquely American recipes using corn meal \u2014 Indian pudding, \"Johnny cake,\" and Indian slapjacks \u2014 as well as the first recipes for pumpkin pudding, winter squash pudding, and for brewing spruce beer. The words \"cookie\" and \"slaw\" made their first published appearance in this book. You'll also find the first recommended use of pearlash (the forerunner of baking powder) to lighten dough, as well as recommendations for seasoning stuffing and roasting beef, mutton, veal, and lamb \u2014 even how to dress a turtle.Along with authentic recipes for colonial favorites, a Glossary includes definitions of antiquated cooking terms: pannikin, wallop, frumenty, emptins, and more. And Mary Tolford Wilson's informative Introductory Essay provides the culinary historical background needed to appreciate this important book fully.Anyone who uses and collects cookbooks will want to have The First American Cookbook. Cultural historians, Americana buffs, and gourmets will find this rare edition filled with interesting recipes and rich in early American flavor.",

Why spend time sorting through the millions of cookie recipes available in books, magazines, and on the Internet? Isn\u2019t it easier just to remember 1-2-3? That\u2019s the ratio of ingredients that always make a basic, delicious cookie dough: 1 part sugar, 2 parts fat, and 3 parts flour. From there, add anything you want\u2014chocolate, lemon and orange zest, nuts, poppy seeds, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, almond extract, or peanut butter, to name a few favorite additions. Replace white sugar with brown for a darker, chewier cookie. Add baking powder and/or eggs for a lighter, airier texture. Ratios are the starting point from which a thousand variations begin. Ratios are the simple proportions of one ingredient to another. Biscuit dough is 3:1:2\u2014or 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, and 2 parts liquid. This ratio is the beginning of many variations, and because the biscuit takes sweet and savory flavors with equal grace, you can top it with whipped cream and strawberries or sausage gravy. Vinaigrette is 3:1, or 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar, and is one of the most useful sauces imaginable, giving everything from grilled meats and fish to steamed vegetables or lettuces intense flavor. Cooking with ratios will unchain you from recipes and set you free. With thirty-three ratios and suggestions for enticing variations, Ratio is the truth of cooking: basic preparations that teach us how the fundamental ingredients of the kitchen\u2014water, flour, butter and oils, milk and cream, and eggs\u2014work. Change the ratio and bread dough becomes pasta dough, cakes become muffins become popovers become crepes. As the culinary world fills up with overly complicated recipes and never-ending ingredient lists, Michael Ruhlman blasts through the surplus of information and delivers this innovative, straightforward book that cuts to the core of cooking. Ratio provides one of the greatest kitchen lessons there is\u2014and it makes the cooking easier and more satisfying than ever.",

In the 1970s, \u201880s and \u201890s Nouvelle cuisine replaced the Haute and Classic cuisine movements with cream and butter replacing meat stocks and rich sauces. Broths, deglazed pans, simple vinaigrettes and sweet and savory purees made sauces lighter and more delicate, under-and-around embracers rather than over-the-top smotherers.

For beginners and professional cooks who want to know everything about the world of sauce making this is the ultimate reference and cookbook. Trained at The Cordon Bleu and Elizabeth Russells in London and working as a professional chef in Knightsbridge and Mayfair and as a food lecturer and demonstrator, lends both the weigh of practical and professional experience to this work.

Have you ever said \"I really want to make that recipe, but I don't have all the ingredients.\" or \"I wish I can just make one meal that satisfies everyone!\"  Whether you have picky eaters, food allergies, food intolerances, celiac disease, diabetes or you just don't have the exact ingredients a recipe calls for, The Formula Cookbook will solve any mealtime dilemma!  How Formulas Work: Our formulas give multiple options with each recipe to give a solution to any of your meal time troubles. The formula can be adjusted for any food allergy or aversion. Each recipe is broken down into the key elements that makes it work.  For example by turning a pancake recipe into a formula you can create not only hundreds of different flavored pancake options, but you can also cater to those with food allergies. It is also flexible. When you see the number in front of an item that is a mandatory item. If the formula doesn't have a number for a topic that means you can pick none, one or all of them!  Here is how we use the formula.  Let's say you have one gluten free child and one dairy free child. Base: Gluten Free Pancake Mix Liquid: Almond Milk, Flavor Blast: Lemon Dry Pudding Mix Mix Ins: Poppy Seeds Toppings: Don't Want Any!  We just created a gluten free, dairy free lemon poppyseed pancake in a few seconds! How easy is that!   About the Authors:  Meg is a chef with a family of four. Her oldest son had a dairy allergy when he was little so she is used to adjusting recipes for food allergies. She trained in Florence, Italy. She has worked as a private chef for families, catered, worked as a restaurant consultant and developed recipes for multiple restaurants and brands. Her passion is to help people feel more comfortable in the kitchen and make mealtime less stressful for all.  Coral is a designer who has a family of six. One of her children has celiac disease and her other children have multiple food allergies and intolerances. Her passion is to bring inspiration and hope to those struggling with food allergies and celiac disease.  Meg and Coral know how hard it can be to prepare a meal for multiple tastes, diets, and food restrictions. The Formula Cookbook is here to change that. This cookbook is literally for everyone. Everyone can benefit from this original concept of turning a recipe into a formula to create endless mealtime possibilities.",

Under Silverton\u2019s guidance, each bite is more exciting and delectable than the last, with recipes such as:Fried Squash Blossoms with RicottaBuricotta with Braised Artichokes, Pine Nuts, Currants, and Mint Pesto Mussels al Forno with Salsa Calabrese Fennel Sausage, Panna, and Scallion Pizza Fresh Ricotta and Egg Ravioli with Brown Butter Grilled Quail Wrapped in Pancetta with Sage and Honey Saut\u00e9ed Cavolo Nero Fritelle di Riso with Nocello-soaked Raisins and Banana Gelato Olive Oil Gelato In the book, Nancy guides you through all the varieties of cheese that she serves at the Mozzarella Bar in the Osteria.

Have you ever said \"I really want to make that recipe, but I don't have all the ingredients.\" or \"I wish I can just make one meal that satisfies everyone!\"  Whether you have picky eaters, food allergies, food intolerances, celiac disease, diabetes or you just don't have the exact ingredients a recipe calls for, The Formula Cookbook will solve any mealtime dilemma!  How Formulas Work: Our formulas give multiple options with each recipe to give a solution to any of your meal time troubles. The formula can be adjusted for any food allergy or aversion. Each recipe is broken down into the key elements that makes it work.  For example by turning a pancake recipe into a formula you can create not only hundreds of different flavored pancake options, but you can also cater to those with food allergies. It is also flexible. When you see the number in front of an item that is a mandatory item. If the formula doesn't have a number for a topic that means you can pick none, one or all of them!  Here is how we use the formula.  Let's say you have one gluten free child and one dairy free child. Base: Gluten Free Pancake Mix Liquid: Almond Milk, Flavor Blast: Lemon Dry Pudding Mix Mix Ins: Poppy Seeds Toppings: Don't Want Any!  We just created a gluten free, dairy free lemon poppyseed pancake in a few seconds! How easy is that!   About the Authors:  Meg is a chef with a family of four. Her oldest son had a dairy allergy when he was little so she is used to adjusting recipes for food allergies. She trained in Florence, Italy. She has worked as a private chef for families, catered, worked as a restaurant consultant and developed recipes for multiple restaurants and brands. Her passion is to help people feel more comfortable in the kitchen and make mealtime less stressful for all.  Coral is a designer who has a family of six. One of her children has celiac disease and her other children have multiple food allergies and intolerances. Her passion is to bring inspiration and hope to those struggling with food allergies and celiac disease.  Meg and Coral know how hard it can be to prepare a meal for multiple tastes, diets, and food restrictions. The Formula Cookbook is here to change that. This cookbook is literally for everyone. Everyone can benefit from this original concept of turning a recipe into a formula to create endless mealtime possibilities.",

        "description": "In her latest cookbook, Deborah Madison, America's leading authority on vegetarian cooking and author of Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone, reveals the surprising relationships between vegetables, edible flowers, and herbs within the same botanical families, and how understanding these connections can help home cooks see everyday vegetables in new light.&nbsp;For over three decades, Deborah Madison has been at the vanguard of the vegetarian cooking movement, authoring classic books on the subject and emboldening millions of readers to cook simple, elegant, plant-based food.This groundbreaking new cookbook is Madison\u2019s crowning achievement: a celebration of the diversity of the plant kingdom, and an exploration of the fascinating relationships between vegetables, edible flowers, herbs, and familiar wild plants within the same botanical families. Destined to become the new standard reference for cooking vegetables, Vegetable Literacy shows cooks that, because of their shared characteristics, vegetables within the same family can be used interchangeably in cooking. It presents an entirely new way of looking at vegetables, drawing on Madison\u2019s deep knowledge of cooking, gardening, and botany. For example, knowing that dill, chervil, cumin, parsley, coriander, anise, lovage, and caraway come from the umbellifer family makes it clear why they\u2019re such good matches for carrots, also a member of that family. With more than 300 classic and exquisitely simple recipes, Madison brings this wealth of information together in dishes that highlight a world of complementary flavors. Griddled Artichokes with Tarragon Mayonnaise, Tomato Soup and Cilantro with Black Quinoa, Tuscan Kale Salad with Slivered Brussels Sprouts and Sesame Dressing, Kohlrabi Slaw with Frizzy Mustard Greens, and Fresh Peas with Sage on Baked Ricotta showcase combinations that are simultaneously familiar and revelatory.Inspiring improvisation in the kitchen and curiosity in the garden, Vegetable Literacy\u2014an unparalleled look at culinary vegetables and plants\u2014will forever change the way we eat and cook.",

        "description": "The bestselling author and internationally celebrated physician and expert on nutrition offers an appealing, approachable health solution\u2014eat the foods you love to lose weight and get healthy. For years, we\u2019ve been told that a healthy diet is heavy on meat, poultry, and fish, and avoids carbohydrates, particularly foods high in starch\u2014empty calories harmful to our bodies. But what if everything we\u2019ve heard was backwards? High in calories and cholesterol, animal fats and proteins too often leave you hungry and lead to overeating and weight gain. They are often the root causes of a host of avoidable health problems\u2014from indigestion, ulcers, and constipation to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, tubers, and other starches provide your body with essential proteins and nutrients that satisfy the appetite while simultaneously fighting illness. But Americans eat far too few calories from carbohydrates\u2014only about&nbsp;forty percent, according to Dr. John McDougall, internationally renowned expert on nutrition and health, featured on the documentary Forks Over Knives. The Healthiest Diet on the Planet helps us reclaim our health by enjoying nutritious starches, vegetables, and fruits. McDougall takes on the propaganda machines pushing dangerous, high-fat fad diets and cuts through the smoke and mirrors of the diet industry. He offers a clear, proven guide to what we should and shouldn\u2019t eat to prevent disease, slow the aging process, improve our physical fitness, be kind to the environment, and be our most attractive selves. Featuring a unique color picture book that shows us exactly what we should and shouldn\u2019t eat, and two dozen color photos of mouth-watering recipes from Mary McDougall, The Healthiest Diet on the Planet is the easiest way to look great, feel better, and forever change the way we think about health and nutrition.",

        "description": "In this innovative cookbook, James Beard award-winning author Michael Ruhlman explains why the egg is the key to the craft of cooking. For culinary visionary Michael Ruhlman, the question is not whether the chicken or the egg came first, it's how anything could be accomplished in the kitchen without the magic of the common egg. He starts with perfect poached and scrambled eggs and builds up to brioche and Italian meringue. Along the way readers learn to make their own mayonnaise, pasta, custards, quiches, cakes, and other preparations that rely fundamentally on the hidden powers of the egg. A unique framework for the book is provided in Ruhlman's egg flowchart, which starts with the whole egg at the top and branches out to describe its many uses and preparations -- boiled, pressure-cooked, poached, fried, coddled, separated, worked into batters and doughs, and more. A removable illustrated flowchart is included with the book. Nearly 100 recipes are grouped by technique and range from simple (Egg Salad with Tarragon and Chives) to sophisticated (nougat). Dozens of step-by-step photographs guide the home cook through this remarkable culinary journey. ",

For more than forty years, the \u201cgodmother of Indian cooking\u201d (The Independent on Sunday) has introduced Western home cooks to the vibrant cuisines of her homeland. Now, in Vegetarian India: A Journey Through the Best of Indian Home Cooking, the seven-time James Beard Award\u2013winning author shares the delectable, healthful, vegetable- and grain-based foods enjoyed around the Indian subcontinent.  Vegetarian cooking is a way of life for more than 300 million Indians. Jaffrey travels from north to south, and from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal, collecting recipes for the very tastiest dishes along the way. She visits the homes and businesses of shopkeepers, writers, designers, farmers, doctors, weavers, and more, gathering their stories and uncovering the secrets of their most delicious family specialties. From a sweet, sour, hot, salty Kodava Mushroom Curry with Coconut originating in the forested regions of South Karnataka to simple, crisp Okra Fries dusted with chili powder, turmeric, and chickpea flour; and from Stir-Fried Spinach, Andhra Style (with ginger, coriander, and cumin) to the mung bean pancakes she snacks on at a roadside stand, here Jaffrey brings together the very best of vegetable-centric Indian cuisine and explains how home cooks can easily replicate these dishes\u2014and many more for beans, grains, and breads\u2014in their own kitchens. With more than two hundred recipes, beautifully illustrated throughout, and including personal photographs from Jaffrey\u2019s own travels, Vegetarian India is a kitchen essential for vegetable enthusiasts and home cooks everywhere.",

These picturesque areas have a rich history of beautiful desserts, many of them tied to holidays and festivals. For example, Zeppole di San Giuseppe are doughnut-like pastries topped with cream and cherries, traditionally made in Campania for the celebration of Father\u2019s Day. And the Sicilian chilled watermelon pudding Gelo di Mellone is a refreshing dish served in summer for the festival of Palermo\u2019s patron saint, Rosalia. Other desserts such as persimmon gelato, chocolate-dipped figs stuffed with almonds and candied orange peel, and chocolate-hazelnut cake rolls celebrate Southern Italy\u2019s local bounty and traditional foods. With recipes for more familiar Italian desserts such as cannoli and gelato, as well as deliciously obscure sweets such as rich cassatas, almond-flecked cookies, and flaky cream-filled sfogliatelle pastries, Southern Italian Desserts features a treat for every occasion.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to explaining the regional history, symbolism, and lore behind the desserts, Costantino teaches you how to stock your dessert pantry and provides all of the foundational recipes you need to embark on a sweet tour of the Italian south from your kitchen.

        "description": "We've all seen them in grocery stores and restaurants: delectably juicy, evenly browned, picture-perfect rotisserie chickens. Do you think they look unattainable, like something that can only be bought in a store and never replicated at home? In truth, it's as easy as can be with a rotisserie oven. A small rotisserie oven that fits right on your kitchen counter will effortlessly transform a humble chicken (and so much more) into a gloriously crispy, moist, and delicious family dinner in about an hour (while you are busy doing other things, or maybe even finding time to relax). The rotisserie is one of the most recent additions to the kitchen-appliance repertoire. What you may not realize is that it's also one of the most versatile and user-friendly. It can cook everything from meat and poultry to vegetable side dishes and desserts; it works without heating up he rest of the kitchen like an over; it's compact enough to occupy only a small amount of valuable counter space; plus, it's easy to clean! In The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook, Diane Phillips creatively takes the rotisserie oven well beyond chicken to every kind of food and every course of the meal. Go on, give it a whirl with recipes such as Calypso Jerk Chicken Kabobs, Roasted Garlic Prime Rib Roast, Plum Crazy Pork Chops, or Roasted Salmon with Mustard Chive Butter. Since the rotisserie bastes food in its own juices and allows excess fat to drain away, everything cooks up lighter and healthier than the same food that is cooked in the traditional oven or stovetop manner. For easy, no-fuss hors d'oeuvres or side dishes, try Blue Bayou Stuffed Mushrooms, Sugar Cane Shrimp, No-Fry Pommes Frites, or Pesto-Grilled Eggplant. With an extensive chapter of marinades, sauces, and rubs to spice things up or cool them down (how about Southwestern Fiesta Rib Sauce or Cucumber Mint Salsa?) and one on desserts to sweeten the deal (ever thought of making Rotisserie Caramel Apples or Fire-Roasted Pineapple with Macadamia Caramel Sauce?), your possibilities are limitless. The Ultimate Rotisserie Cookbook is, simply, the be-all and end-all book for the rotisserie oven, with 300 recipes for every possible way you could think of to use this amazing machine.",

Accompanied by striking photographs and brief, straightforward instructions, these thematic matrices show how simple changes in preparation and ingredient swaps in a master recipe can yield dishes that are each completely different from the original, and equally delicious. In Mark Bittman\u2019s Kitchen Matrix, Mark\u2019s matrices come together to create a collection of over 400 flexible recipes covering vegetables, fruits, meats and chicken, and even desserts. Whether you're cooking up soup (creamy, brothy, earthy, or hearty), freezing ice pops (in fruity, savory, creamy, or boozy varieties), or preparing asparagus (steamed, roasted, stir-fried, or grilled), following Mark\u2019s approach to culinary improvisation will deliver stand-out results.",

        "description": "James Beard Award Winner (Vegetarian)IACP Award Winner (Healthy Eating) A sophisticated vegetarian cookbook with all the tools you need to be at home in your kitchen, cooking in the most nourishing and delicious ways\u2014from the foundations of stocking a pantry and understanding your ingredients, to preparing elaborate seasonal feasts. Imagine you are in a bright, breezy kitchen. There are large bowls on the counter full of lush, colorful produce and a cake stand stacked with pretty whole-grain muffins. On the shelves live rows of glass jars containing grains, seeds, beans, nuts, and spices. You open the fridge and therein you find a bottle of fresh almond milk, cooked beans, soaking grains, dressings, ferments, and seasonal produce. This is Amy Chaplin\u2019s kitchen. It is a heavenly place, and this book will make it your kitchen too.With her love of whole food and knowledge as a chef, Chaplin has written a book that will inspire you to eat well at every meal. Part One lays the foundation for stocking the pantry. This is not just a list of food and equipment; it\u2019s real working information\u2014how and why to use ingredients\u2014and an arsenal of simple recipes for daily nourishment. Also included throughout are tips on living a whole food lifestyle: planning weekly menus, why organic is important, composting, plastics vs. glass, drinking tea, doing a whole food cleanse, and much more.Part Two is a collection of recipes (most of which are naturally gluten-free) celebrating vegetarian cuisine in its brightest, whole, sophisticated form. Black rice breakfast pudding with coconut and banana? Yes, please. Beet tartlets with poppy seed crust and white bean fennel filling? I\u2019ll take two.

        "description": "The answers to many kitchen conundrums in one easy-to-use volume, from the author of the acclaimed culinary bible On Food and Cooking.    From our foremost expert on the science of cooking, Harold McGee, Keys to Good Cooking is a concise and authoritative guide designed to help home cooks navigate the ever-expanding universe of ingredients, recipes, food safety, and appliances, and arrive at the promised land of a satisfying dish.  A work of astounding scholarship and originality, Keys to Good Cooking directly addresses the cook at work in the kitchen and in need of quick and reliable guidance. Cookbooks past and present frequently contradict one another about the best ways to prepare foods, and many contain erroneous information and advice.  Keys to Good Cooking distills the modern scientific understanding of cooking and translates it into immediately useful information. Looking at ingredients from the mundane to the exotic, McGee takes you from market to table, teaching, for example, how to spot the most delectable asparagus (choose thick spears); how to best prepare the vegetable (peel, don't snap, the fibrous ends; broiling is one effective cooking method for asparagus and other flat-lying vegetables); and how to present it (coat with butter or oil after cooking to avoid a wrinkled surface). This book will be a requisite countertop resource for all home chefs, as McGee's insights on kitchen safety in particular-reboil refrigerated meat or fish stocks every few days. (They're so perishable that they can spoil even in the refrigerator.); Don't put ice cubes or frozen gel packs on a burn. (Extreme cold can cause additional skin damage)-will save even the most knowledgeable home chefs from culinary disaster.  A companion volume to recipe books, a touchstone that helps cooks spot flawed recipes and make the best of them, Keys to Good Cooking will be of use to cooks of all kinds: to beginners who want to learn the basics, to weekend cooks who want a quick refresher in the basics, and to accomplished cooks who want to rethink a dish from the bottom up. With Keys to Good Cooking McGee has created an essential guide for food lovers everywhere.",

        "description": "Many cookbooks try to teach you how to feed a family of six on weeknights using as few ingredients as possible, in as short a time as possible\u2014that is, mere sustenance. At the other end of the spectrum are those books with endless ingredient lists and cooking instructions that take the better part of a weekend, trying to teach you how to re-create world-class restaurant food at home\u2014that is, mere fantasy. But neither approach teaches you how to do the one thing that has the greatest impact: to combine great-tasting food with great-looking food, to make guests say \"Wow\" as soon as they sit at the table, and then again when they take their first bites.Dishing With Style fills that need. This is the book that will teach you how to create delicious, showstopping dishes for every course of the meal, from cocktails and hors d'oeuvres through first courses, entr\u00e9es, and dessert. The recipes include classics like Roasted Lamb Chops with Orange, Garlic, and Rosemary Pesto Rub with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Mashed Potatoes; Mediterranean favorites such as Grilled Tuscan-Style Steak with Focaccia Salsa, or Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me; Asian-inspired dishes like Miso-Glazed Seared Tuna with Fresh Herb Salad; and such Latin flavors as Shredded Pork Burritos with Ancho Chile Sauce and Sangria Granita. Nearly every recipe includes two stunning options for presenting the dish to your guests. One is more casual, often family-style, perfect for Sunday suppers and backyard get-togethers\u2014but no matter how relaxed the event, there's no reason for the food to be anything other than beautiful. The other option is more elegant, usually served in individual plated portions, for dinner parties and more formal affairs. The recipes for both choices use the same ingredients and cooking method, but branch off at the end of the instructions, depending on what style you want for your service. No matter which presentation you choose, none of these recipes is complex. Rori Trovato knows that the secret to great party-throwing is for the host or hostess to be relaxed, not to be spending every minute in the kitchen preparing last-minute sauces and elaborate garnishes. So whether you're using the good china or the paper plates, Dishing With Style will show you how to pull it off with scrumptious food in beautiful settings\u2014that is, how to dish with style.",

Have you ever said \"I really want to make that recipe, but I don't have all the ingredients.\" or \"I wish I can just make one meal that satisfies everyone!\"  Whether you have picky eaters, food allergies, food intolerances, celiac disease, diabetes or you just don't have the exact ingredients a recipe calls for, The Formula Cookbook will solve any mealtime dilemma!  How Formulas Work: Our formulas give multiple options with each recipe to give a solution to any of your meal time troubles. The formula can be adjusted for any food allergy or aversion. Each recipe is broken down into the key elements that makes it work.  For example by turning a pancake recipe into a formula you can create not only hundreds of different flavored pancake options, but you can also cater to those with food allergies. It is also flexible. When you see the number in front of an item that is a mandatory item. If the formula doesn't have a number for a topic that means you can pick none, one or all of them!  Here is how we use the formula.  Let's say you have one gluten free child and one dairy free child. Base: Gluten Free Pancake Mix Liquid: Almond Milk, Flavor Blast: Lemon Dry Pudding Mix Mix Ins: Poppy Seeds Toppings: Don't Want Any!  We just created a gluten free, dairy free lemon poppyseed pancake in a few seconds! How easy is that!   About the Authors:  Meg is a chef with a family of four. Her oldest son had a dairy allergy when he was little so she is used to adjusting recipes for food allergies. She trained in Florence, Italy. She has worked as a private chef for families, catered, worked as a restaurant consultant and developed recipes for multiple restaurants and brands. Her passion is to help people feel more comfortable in the kitchen and make mealtime less stressful for all.  Coral is a designer who has a family of six. One of her children has celiac disease and her other children have multiple food allergies and intolerances. Her passion is to bring inspiration and hope to those struggling with food allergies and celiac disease.  Meg and Coral know how hard it can be to prepare a meal for multiple tastes, diets, and food restrictions. The Formula Cookbook is here to change that. This cookbook is literally for everyone. Everyone can benefit from this original concept of turning a recipe into a formula to create endless mealtime possibilities.",

        "description": "Time-honored cocktails like the New York Sour and the Sidecar were born during the era of Prohibition, the blessedly bygone social experiment that turned drinking into an underground adventure. In those days, hard beverage options were usually made with homemade hooch and flavorings of dubious origin and quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully, a cocktail renaissance has emerged in many of today\u2019s bars, where inventive drinks showcase both the artistry and craft of bartending. At their moody and atmospheric West Village bar-restaurant Employees Only, master mixologists Jason Kosmas and Dushan Zaric can regale you with colorful tales of cocktail origins\u2014or just pour you a mean drink. In Speakeasy, Kosmas and Zaric take their inspiration from traditional favorites, then use the finest spirits, the freshest ingredients, and a good measure of reverence for their craft to elevate the mixed drink to artisanal status.&nbsp;More than 80 imaginative libations that riff on the classics are showcased in this one-of-a-kind collection. Recipes emphasize fresh fruits and herbs, homemade syrups and infusions, and a careful balancing of flavors, with a mind toward seasonality. A Ginger Smash is offered in four different versions: kumquat, pineapple, pear, or cranberry, depending on the time of year. The Millionaire becomes the Billionaire with the addition of homemade grenadine and 107-proof bourbon. And the South Side becomes the West Side by replacing the gin with sun-kissed Meyer lemon\u2013infused vodka. With the specter of Prohibition firmly in the past, Speakeasy shares recipes for the choicest potent potables, reimagining the finest drinks of yesterday for today\u2019s thirsty imbibers.",

Finally, the energy and style that make Barefoot Contessa such a special place are shown here, with dozens of recipes and more than 160 breathtaking photographs, in The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ina's most popular recipes use familiar ingredients and yield amazing results. Her Pan-Fried Onion Dip is the real thing, with slowly caramelized onions and fresh sour cream. Tomato soup is created from oven-roasted tomatoes and fresh basil to intensify the flavors. Meat loaf is as good as your grandmother's, but it's healthier because it's made with ground turkey and fresh herbs. The light and flaky Maple-Oatmeal Scones are baked with rolled oats, whole wheat, and real maple syrup. Now these and other famous Barefoot Contessa recipes can be prepared at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ina says that before she owned a specialty food store she often spent a week making dinner for six friends. Her experience at Barefoot Contessa has given her hundreds of ideas for creating wonderful parties in a few hours. And they're all in this book. Crab Cakes with R\u00e9moulade Sauce can be stored overnight in the refrigerator and saut\u00e9ed just before the guests arrive. Cheddar Corn Chowder can be made days ahead, reheated, and served with a salad and bread for a delicious autumn lunch.

The batter for the Raspberry Corn Muffins can be mixed a day before and popped into the oven just before breakfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ina Garten teaches us how to entertain with style, simplicity, and a relaxed sense of fun. There are notes throughout the book for giving cocktail parties, lunches, and dinner parties where everything is done before the guests arrive.

Once only accessible to pastry chefs and candy makers, home cooks can now purchase high-end domestic and imported chocolates in their local specialty stores. The recent availability of bittersweet chocolates coupled with our access to a global food market and unique ingredients has created an increased interest in artisanal chocolates. Drew Shotts has been at the forefront of this renaissance because of his daring use of unique flavor combinations not typically associated with chocolates, such as chili peppers, maple syrup, and spiced chai tea.

        "description": "Food and cooking are at the heart of Jewish life. During their 2,000 years of exile, Jews migrated across the world taking their culinary heritage and traditions with them. Wherever they settled, they adapted the dishes of their country of residence to fit their own dietary customs and laws, and as a result, Jewish food today embraces a vast variety of cuisines and cooking styles. Acclaimed food writer Paola Gavin takes the reader on a culinary journey through more than twenty countries from Poland to Morocco uncovering a myriad traditional vegetarian dishes that play such an important part in Jewish cooking. When Jews arrived in the Promised Land they became farmers and agriculturists, growing wheat, barley, rye and millet. Their diet was mainly vegetarian \u2013 based on bread, pulses, goat's and sheep's cheese, olives and nuts, vegetables and herbs, fresh and dried fruit. For the poor, food was made more palatable by sweetening with honey or syrup made from dates, pomegranates, or carob beans. These are some of the unique tastes and ingredients that are still associated with modern Jewish cooking today. Through 150 recipes Paola leads us from North Africa to Italy, Lithuania, Turkey and beyond, examining the subtle differences and genesis of the dishes of these regions. With lavish, colorful food photography and a meticulously researched narrative, Hazana is a classic in cookbook writing.",

        "description": "From sleek, silken tofu with delicate toppings to piping-hot fried satchels in a robust sauce, tofu provides a versatile canvas for the intricate flavors and textures that Asian and vegetarian cooks have long enjoyed. America has embraced tofu as a healthy, affordable ingredient. And while it has been welcomed into sophisticated mainstream dining, tofu is often hidden in Western guises and in limited applications. In her third intrepid cookbook, celebrated food writer and teacher ANDREA NGUYEN aims to elevate this time-honored staple to a new place of prominence on every table.  Asian Tofu\u2019s nearly 100 recipes explore authentic,ancient fare and modern twists that capture the culinary spirit of East, Southeast, and South Asia. There are spectacular favorites from Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and India, as well as delicious dishes from Taipei, San Francisco, Santa Monica, and New York. Andrea demystifies tofu and interprets traditional Asian cuisine for cooks, sharing compelling personal stories and dispatches from some of the world\u2019s best tofu artisans along the way. For those who want to take their skills to the next level, the tofu tutorial clearly outlines tofu-making technique, encouraging readers to experiment with the unparalleled flavors of homemade varieties. But time-pressed cooks needn\u2019t fear: while a few recipes, such as Silken Tofu and Seasoned Soy Milk Hot Pot, are truly best with homemade tofu, most are terrific with store-bought products. Some traditional dishes combine tofu with meat in brilliant partnerships, such as Spicy Tofu with Beef and Sichuan Peppercorn and Tofu with Kimchi and Pork Belly, but this collection is predominantly vegetarian and vegan, including the pristinely flavored Spiced Tofu and Coconut in Banana Leaf and vibrant Spicy Lemongrass Tofu Salad. And innovations such as Okara Doughnuts reveal tofu\u2019s more playful side. For health- and eco-conscious eaters and home chefs who are inspired to make the journey from bean to curd, Asian Tofu is the perfect guide.",

In its latest incarnation, the restaurant has evolved toward a lighter, leaner, simpler cuisine, one that keeps all the spirit and refinement of the original menu but depends more on the excitement of sparkling fresh produce and its integral relationship to the dishes it inspires.In close to 300 original recipes, the new Greens style includes exuberant salads, soups, the legendary crusty Greens pizzas, curries and hearty stews, grilled vegetables, and intriguing turnovers made with filo pastry, tortillas, and savory doughs.&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course there are heavenly breads and the famous desserts, like ginger pound cake with poached apricots and cherries.&nbsp;&nbsp;This cornucopia of brilliant dishes focuses on tantalizing tastes, with a new simplicity, clarity, and liveliness as its hallmark.Annie Somerville, the executive chef at Greens, goes right to the heart of the matter: extraordinary produce that's bursting with flavor, color, and texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of her favorites--like crinkly Bloomsdale spinach, candy-striped Chioggia beets, succulent Rosefir potatoes--are highlighted in the text for gardeners and farmers' market aficionados.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Greens style is above all accessible; ordinary red beets will be just fine if more exotic varieties are unavailable.&nbsp;&nbsp;To help with availability, there's information on locating farmers' markets throughout the country as well as sources for plants, seeds, and local resources.Because the garden is at the center of this book, readers are encouraged to try their hand, in tiny backyards and windowsill boxes if necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Invaluable growing tips are offered from Green Gulch Farm, the source of much of the stunning produce served at the restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other special features include a section on low-fat cooking and another on pairing wine with vegetarian food.All of the abundance and exuberance that the title Fields of Greens implies is here, for the novice as well as the expert, for simple last-minute meals as well as extravagant occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;For truly inspired contemporary vegetarian cooking, Fields of Greens is the essential sourcebook.Annie Somerville trained under Deborah Madison, the founding chef at Greens Restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Somerville's guidance as executive chef, Greens has become a culinary landmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work has been featured in Gourmet, Food &amp; Wine, Ladies' Home Journal, SF, and California magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp;She also contributed to The Open Hand Cookbook and Women Chefs cookbook.",

He is the best, and has even been described as a couturier of pastry. This is a man at the top of his art and there is no question his macarons are in a league of its own. Macarons are the aristocrats of pastry; these brightly colored, mini meringues, daintily sandwiched together with gooey fillings, have become a holy grail for cookery fanatics and there are even food blogs dedicated to them. Now for the first time, all the macaron recipes from this most celebrated French p\u00e2tissier are published in English. The French language edition has been one of the most sought after cookbooks of recent years. And just like Pierre Herm\u00e9\u2019s famous macarons, it would be difficult for any macaron book to surpass this one. There are 200 pages of recipes and beautiful food photography, and because making macarons is mostly about technique, rather than just a standard recipe, readers will appreciate the 32-step-by-step photo-illustrated instructions for making shells and fillings. All the classics are here like dark chocolate, praline, coffee, and pistachio, but others feature the more unusual macarons that Herm\u00e9 is justly famous for: Isfahan is one, with lychee, rose and raspberry, Arabesque with apricot and pistachio, Satine with passion fruit, orange and cream cheese, Mandarin and pink pepper, black truffles, balsamic vinegar as well as a bright-green macaron filled with fresh mint. Anyone interested in making macarons will find Pierre Herm\u00e9\u2019s the best book in print.REVIEWS \u201cAll my high hopes and expectations for this book have been exceeded.

        "description": "Great day in the morning, BakeWise is out! You are holding the book that everyone has been waiting for. Sure enough, Shirley did not hold back\u2014it's all here. Lively and fascinating, BakeWise reads like a mystery novel as we follow sleuth Shirley while she solves everything from why cakes and muffins can be dry to g\u00e9noise deflation and why the cookie crumbles.With her years of experience from big-pot cooking for 140 teenage boys and her classic French culinary training to her work as a research biochemist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Shirley manages to put two and two together in unique and exciting ways. Some information is straight out of Shirley's wildly connecting brain cells. She describes useful techniques, such as brushing puff pastry with ice water\u2014not just brushing off the flour\u2014making the puff pastry easier to roll. The result? Higher, lighter, and flakier pastry. And you won't find these recipes anywhere else, not even on the Internet. She can help you make moist cakes; flaky pie crusts; shrink-proof perfect meringues that won't leak but still cut like a dream; big, crisp cream puffs; amazing French pastries; light g\u00e9noise; and crusty, incredibly flavorful, open-textured French breads, such as baguettes and fougasses.  There is simply no one like Shirley Corriher. People everywhere recognize her from her TV appearances on the Food Network and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, with Snoop Dogg as her fry chef.  Restaurant chefs and culinary students know her from their grease-splattered copies of CookWise, an encyclopedic work that has saved them from many a cooking disaster. With numerous \u201cAt-a-Glance\u201d charts, BakeWise gives busy people information for quick problem solving. BakeWise also includes Shirley's \u201cWhat This Recipe Shows\u201d in every recipe. This section is science and culinary information that can apply to hundreds of recipes, not just the one in which it appears. For years, food editors and writers have kept CookWise, Shirley's previous book, right by their computers. Now that spot they've been holding for BakeWise can be filled. BakeWise does not have just a single source of knowledge; Shirley loves reading the works of chefs and other good cooks and shares their information with you, too. She applies not only her expertise but that of the many artisans she admires, such as famous French pastry chefs Gaston Len\u00f4tre and Chef Roland Mesnier, the White House executive pastry chef for twenty-five years; Bruce Healy, author of Mastering the Art of French Pastry; and Bonnie Wagner, Shirley's daughter-inlaw's mother. Shirley also retrieves \"lost arts\" from experts of the past such as Monroe Boston Strause, the pie master of 1930s America. For one dish, she may give you techniques from three or four different chefs plus her own touch ofscience\u2014\u201cbetter baking through chemistry.\u201d She adds facts about the right temperature, the right mixing speed, and the right mixing time for the absolutely most stable egg foam, so you can create a light-as-air g\u00e9noise every time. BakeWise is for everyone. Some will read it for the adventure of problem solving with Shirley. Beginners can cook from it and know exactly what they are doing and why. Experienced bakers find out why the techniques they use work and also uncover amazing French pastries out of the past, such as Pont Neuf (a creation of puff pastry, p\u00e2te \u00e0 choux, and pastry cream in honor of the Paris bridge) and Religieuses, adorable \u201clittle nuns\u201d made of puff pastry filled with a satiny chocolate pastry cream and drizzled with mocha icing to form a nun's habit. Some will want it simply for the recipes\u2014incredibly moist whipped cream pound cake made with heavy cream whipped slightly beyond the soft-peak stage and folded into the batter; flourless fruit souffl\u00e9s (pur\u00e9ed fruit and Italian meringue); Chocolate Crinkle Cookies, rolled first in granulated sugar and then in confectioners' sugar for a crunchy black-and-snow-white surface with a gooey, fudgy center.

It\u2019s a fulfilling and immensely economical process, one perfectly suited for our times\u2014although, as Jones points out, cooking for one also means we can occasionally indulge ourselves in a favorite treat.Throughout, Jones is both our instructor and our mentor, suggesting basic recipes\u2014such as tomato sauce, preserved lemons, pesto, and homemade stock\u2014that all cooks should have on hand; teaching us how to improvise using an ingenious strategy of building meals through the week; and supplying us with a lifetime\u2019s worth of tips and shortcuts.

        "product_name": "The Boat Galley Cookbook: 800 Everyday Recipes and Essential Tips for Cooking Aboard",
        "description": "No matter what anyone tells you, boat cooking IS different from cooking ashore. The space is smaller, there\u2019s no grocery store 5 minutes away, you have fewer prepared foods and electric appliances, and food storage is much different.  Despite cruising different oceans, we\u2015Jan and Carolyn--both faced the same challenges: eating well while having time to enjoy all the other great aspects of cruising. We love to snorkel, swim, kayak, explore\u2015and just sit and admire the view.  We learned with the cookbooks we both had aboard, and wished for information that wasn't available--like when Jan ended up with a frozen chicken complete with head and feet and no instructions on how to cut it up.  When we couldn't get foods such as sour cream, English muffins, spaghetti sauce or yogurt, we adapted recipes to make our own. Other times, we experimented with substituting ingredients--maybe the result wasn\u2019t identical, but it was still tasty. We ended up with over 150 substitutions and dozens of \u201cmake it yourself\u201d options. As we traded recipes and knowledge with each other, we realized we were compiling information that became The Boat Galley Cookbook: 800+ recipes made from readily-obtainable ingredients with hand utensils, including numerous choices to suit every taste: not just one cake but 20, 16 ways to prepare fish, 10 regional barbeque sauces, and so on. Step-by-step directions to give even \u201cnon-cooks\u201d the confidence they can turn out tasty meals without prepared foods. Detailed instructions on unfamiliar things like making yogurt and bread, grilling virtually every food imaginable, preparing and cooking freshly-caught fish and seafood, cutting up and boning meat, cooking in a Thermos and baking on the stove top, as well as lots of tips on how to do things more easily in a tiny, moving kitchen. All this in an easy-to-navigate format including side tabs on the Contents to help you find your way and extensive cross reference lists at the end of each chapter. Quick Reference Lists provide idea starters: suggestions of included recipes for such categories as Mexican, Asian, and Potluck. The Boat Galley Cookbook is designed to help you every step of the way. We hope it becomes a trusted reference on your boat, and a source of many enjoyable meals.",

        "description": "When Paula Haney first opened the Hoosier Mama Pie Company on March 14, 2009 (Pi day, appropriately enough), she worried whether her new business could survive by specializing in just one thing. When she opened her storefront that morning and saw a line around the block, she realized she had a more immediate problem: had she made enough pie? The shop closed early that day, but it has been churning out plenty of the Chicago's most delectable pies ever since.Since starting her career as a pastry chef at Trio, one of Chicago's top fine-dining restaurants, Haney dreamed of opening her own pie shop. Exhilarating and exhausting days spent creating fabulous new desserts to keep up with the restaurant's head chef--a then-unknown Grant Achatz, who would go on to culinary superstardom--left Haney in search of classic comfort food on her days off. Her disappointment in being unable to find a good slice of pie in all of Chicago led her to one conclusion: she needed to open her own store.Specializing in hand-made, artisanal pies that only use locally sourced and in-season ingredients, Hoosier Mama Pie Company has become a local favorite and a national destination gaining praise from Bon Appetit, the Food Network, and Food &amp; Wine as one of the top pie shops in the country. Now, The Hoosier Mama Book of Pie delivers all the sumptuous secrets of buttery crusts, fruity fillings, creams and custards, chess pies, over-the-top pies, and even the stout and hearty savory pie. The practically oriented, easy-going, and accessible style of this book will help bakers both new and old make the perfect pie for every occasion.On top of all of this, The Hooser Mama Book of Pie also includes tips on technique, fascinating historical anecdotes, and an emphasis on special seasonal recipes, as well as quiches, hand pies, and scones. This beautifully photographed and designed book has the classic retro feel of the mid-20th century golden age of pie, and all the warmth and personality of the Hoosier Mama Pie Co.'s cozy Chicago storefront. The focus on using local produce and employing the farm-to-table philosophy gives the book a contemporary twist, helping home bakers make the freshest, most delicious pies imaginable. Now readers can take a little piece of the Hoosier Mama Pie Company anywhere they go.",

        "description": "Three hundred newly discovered recipes drawn from Pierre Franey's famed \"60-Minute Gourmet\" columns in The New York Times The master chef's legions of fans will be delighted to learn of such surprising culinary good fortune. Prepared with Pierre Franey's characteristic flair and ebullience, this new collection offers three hundred recipes that appeared in The New York Times but were never before published in a cookbook. These recipes are as delicious as those in his two earlier 60-Minute Gourmet collections and combine everything that was great about Pierre Franey's cooking: fresh, flavorful, low-fat ingredients, ease of preparation, and the commandment \"Don't spend all evening in the kitchen!\" Following a successful career as a restaurant chef, Pierre Franey became a food writer for The New York Times in 1975, when he accepted the challenge to write a regular column featuring recipes that would take less than one hour to prepare. Though he was initially concerned that the time limit might detract from the quality of the dishes, he quickly recalled the delicious foods prepared in his childhood home in France, which often took very little time to cook. Over the two decades that his column appeared, he developed thousands of dishes that can--indeed, must--be made in only minutes to bring them to a state of absolute perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking with the 60-Minute Gourmet is a dazzling collection of great recipes. The book opens with appetizers, salads, and soups, then moves into meats, poultry, seafood, pasta, and, finally, desserts. Among the many delectable recipes are Green Bean and Red Pepper Salad, Lobster and Wild Rice Salad, Double Veal Chops with Braised Spring Vegetables, Sirloin Steak with Crushed Peppercorns, Roasted Baby Chickens with Spicy Mango Barbecue Sauce, Shrimp with Snow Peas and Tomatoes, Fettuccine with Goat Cheese and Asparagus, Broiled Fennel and Zucchini with Parmesan Cheese, Summer Fruit Salad, and Poached Pears in Red Wine and Cassis. A special tribute to Pierre Franey is offered in a fond Foreword by his lifelong friend the master chef Jacques P\u00e9pin. The recipes have been collected and updated by Bryan Miller, a longtime collaborator of Franey's, with help from Claudia Franey Jensen, one of p\u00e8re Franey's daughters, who has also contributed an Introduction. As a step-by-step guide and an inspiration for better eating, this great cookbook will soon be considered a must in every home cook's library.",

        "description": "Beautifully translated for a new generation of devotees of delicious and healthy eating: &nbsp;a groundbreaking, mouthwatering vegetarian cookbook originally published in Yiddish in pre\u2013World War II Vilna and miraculously rediscovered more than half a century later.&nbsp;In 1938, Fania Lewando, the proprietor of a popular vegetarian restaurant in Vilna, Lithuania, published a Yiddish vegetarian cookbook unlike any that had come before. Its 400 recipes ranged from traditional Jewish dishes (kugel, blintzes, fruit compote, borscht) to vegetarian versions of Jewish holiday staples (cholent, kishke, schnitzel) to appetizers, soups, main courses, and desserts that introduced vegetables and fruits that had not traditionally been part of the repertoire of the Jewish homemaker (Chickpea Cutlets, Jerusalem Artichoke Soup; Leek Frittata; Apple Charlotte with Whole Wheat Breadcrumbs). Also included were impassioned essays by Lewando and by a physician about the benefits of vegetarianism. Accompanying the recipes were lush full-color drawings of vegetables and fruit that had originally appeared on bilingual (Yiddish and English) seed packets. Lewando's cookbook was sold throughout Europe.&nbsp;Lewando and her husband died during World War II, and it was assumed that all but a few family-owned and archival copies of her cookbook vanished along with most of European Jewry. But in 1995 a couple attending an antiquarian book fair in England came upon a copy of Lewando's cookbook. Recognizing its historical value, they purchased it and donated it to the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York City, the premier repository for books and artifacts relating to prewar European Jewry. Enchanted by the book's contents and by its backstory, YIVO commissioned a translation of the book that will make Lewando's charming, delicious, and practical recipes available to an audience beyond the wildest dreams of the visionary woman who created them.With a foreword by Joan Nathan.&nbsp;Full-color illustrations throughout.Translated from the Yiddish by Eve Jochnowitz.",

        "description": "Chef Chloe Coscarelli has revolutionized how vegans cook and eat with exciting, plant-based recipes that are fun, full of flavor, and make you feel healthier. When she decided to become a vegan chef, she dreamed of changing the way the world ate. This was in the \u201cpre-kale\u201d days, when veggie burgers were frozen, tasteless patties loathed by the general public and if a vegan wanted to eat, well, then she had to cook! Today, corner stores stock their shelves with almond milk and mainstream restaurants pepper their menus with quinoa, tempeh, chia seeds, faro, ramps, and so many variations of avocado toast. There is truly no better time to love to eat than now\u2014and no easier time to be a vegan.&nbsp;Chloe believes the most delicious dishes come from plant-based ingredients, and has debunked the myth that vegan cooking is bland and visually unenticing. Enter: CHLOE FLAVOR. Every recipe here is bold in taste, loud in color, unabashedly unique, and, above all, easy to make. With dishes like Smoky Grits &amp; Greens, Mango-Guacamole Crunch Burgers, and Sea Salted Chocolate Chunk Cookies, this food is for fun, friends, and family\u2014and it\u2019s all about the flavor. Vegans will delight in Chloe\u2019s creations and carnivores won\u2019t miss the meat one bit.  First breaking onto the culinary scene as the only vegan chef to capture the top prize on Food Network\u2019s Cupcake Wars, Chef Chloe Coscarelli has since been recognized for bringing vegan cuisine to the mainstream as an award-winning chef, successful entrepreneur, and bestselling cookbook author. She has published three bestselling cookbooks, and in 2015 she opened her first restaurant, by CHLOE., bringing healthy and satisfying vegan and plant-based dishes to the masses. She lives in New York City.",

He is the best, and has even been described as a couturier of pastry. This is a man at the top of his art and there is no question his macarons are in a league of its own. Macarons are the aristocrats of pastry; these brightly colored, mini meringues, daintily sandwiched together with gooey fillings, have become a holy grail for cookery fanatics and there are even food blogs dedicated to them. Now for the first time, all the macaron recipes from this most celebrated French p\u00e2tissier are published in English. The French language edition has been one of the most sought after cookbooks of recent years. And just like Pierre Herm\u00e9\u2019s famous macarons, it would be difficult for any macaron book to surpass this one. There are 200 pages of recipes and beautiful food photography, and because making macarons is mostly about technique, rather than just a standard recipe, readers will appreciate the 32-step-by-step photo-illustrated instructions for making shells and fillings. All the classics are here like dark chocolate, praline, coffee, and pistachio, but others feature the more unusual macarons that Herm\u00e9 is justly famous for: Isfahan is one, with lychee, rose and raspberry, Arabesque with apricot and pistachio, Satine with passion fruit, orange and cream cheese, Mandarin and pink pepper, black truffles, balsamic vinegar as well as a bright-green macaron filled with fresh mint. Anyone interested in making macarons will find Pierre Herm\u00e9\u2019s the best book in print.REVIEWS \u201cAll my high hopes and expectations for this book have been exceeded.
