How do great coaches turn a collection of individuals into a coherent \u201cus\u201d?&nbsp;&nbsp;Seth Davis, one of the keenest minds in sports journalism, has been thinking about that question for twenty-five years. It\u2019s one of the things that drove him to write the definitive biography of college basketball\u2019s greatest coach, John Wooden,&nbsp;Wooden: A Coach\u2019s Life. But John Wooden coached a long time ago. The world has changed, and coaching has too, tremendously. Seth Davis decided to embark on a proper investigation to get to the root of the matter.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Getting to Us, Davis probes and prods the best of the best from the landscape of active coaches of football and basketball, college and pro\u2014from Urban Meyer, Dabo Swinney, and Jim Harbaugh to Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo, Jim Boeheim, Brad Stevens, Geno Auriemma, and Doc Rivers\u2014to get at the fundamental ingredients of greatness in the coaching sphere. There\u2019s no single right way, of course\u2014part of the great value of this book is Davis\u2019s distillation of what he has learned about different types of greatness in coaching, and what sort of leadership thrives in one kind of environment but not in others. Some coaches have thrived at the college level but not in the pros. Why? What\u2019s the difference? Some coaches are stern taskmasters, others are warm and cuddly; some are brilliant strategists but less emotionally involved with their players, and with others it\u2019s vice versa. In&nbsp;Getting to Us, we come to feel a deep connection with the most successful and iconic coaches in all of sports\u2014big winners and big characters, whose stories offer much of enduring interest and value.",

Known as one of the hardest-working and highest-achieving players in NBA history, this most dedicated competitor was legendary for his sharp shooting. From the Outside,&nbsp;complete with a foreword by Spike Lee,&nbsp;is his story in his words: a no-holds-barred look at his life and career, filled with behind-the-scenes stories and surprising revelations about the game he has always cherished.Allen talks openly about his fellow players, coaches, owners, and friends, including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Kevin Garnett. He reveals how, as a kid growing up in a military family, he learned about responsibility and respect\u2014the key to making those perfect free throws and critical three-point shots.From the Outside is the portrait of a gifted athlete and a serious man with a strongly defined philosophy about the game and the right way it should be played\u2014a philosophy that, at times, set him apart from colleagues and coaches, while inspiring so many others, and lead to the most pivotal shot of his career: the unforgettable 3-pointer in the final seconds of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals against the San Antonio Spurs. Throughout, Allen makes clear that success in basketball is as much about what happens off the court as on, that devotion and commitment are the true essence of the game\u2014and of life itself.",

Masterfully assembled by longtime Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, Basketball spans eight decades to bring together a dream team of writers as awe-inspiring and endlessly inventive as the game itself. Here are in-depth profiles of the legends of the hardcourt--Russell, Kareem, Bird, Jordan, and LeBron--and storied franchises such as the Knicks and Celtics, along with dazzling portraits of the flash and sizzle of playground ball and more personal reflections on the game by some of America's finest writers, among them Donald Hall, John Edgar Wideman, and Pat Conroy. Highlights include James Naismith recalling how he invented the game that would go on to conquer the world; John McPhee capturing the ever-disciplined Bill Bradley as a Princeton Tiger; Peter Goldman's indelible portrait of the life and death of a Harlem Globetrotter; and Michael Lewis's account of the brave new world of NBA analytics. Classic journalism about inner-city basketball by Pete Axthelm, Rick Telander, and Darcy Frey is joined by stories of the game's popularity across America, from the heartland of Hoosier country to an Apache Reservation in Arizona.Cover: Copyright \u00a9 1996 by NBAE.

    "product_name": "Old School Grit: Times May Change, But the Rules for Success Never Do (Sports for the Soul) (Volume 2)",
    "description": "The 15 Unbreakable Rules for Building Grit and Achieving Your Dreams! Psychologists tell us that the secret to a successful and happy life, more than anything else, is something called GRIT. Defined as the willpower to persevere with passion and a sense of purpose, research shows that grit is what matters most in whether a person succeeds or fails. That same research shows that previous generations had a lot more grit than today\u2019s younger generations. This isn\u2019t surprising. After all, most of us would agree that those older, wiser, and tougher members of the Greatest Generation are prime examples of what it means to persevere, to never back down, and to make sacrifices for a greater purpose. We could all use more of the OLD SCHOOL GRIT they embraced. In this inspirational fable, Bob Flanagan represents the voice of old school grit. A legendary college basketball coach who thinks like John Wooden and talks like Mike Ditka, Flanagan is entering the final days of his coaching career. While his team tries to advance through the NCAA postseason tournament, Flanagan uses his last days as a coach to write his grandchildren letters revealing the rules for a successful and happy life. The rules of grit. Though Coach Flanagan\u2019s letters are intended for his grandchildren, they might as well be for America in general. This is a man who lives by the old school code of faith, family, courage, and character; and he believes too many people have gone soft these days. They give up on their dreams too easily. They whine, complain, and pass the blame. They spend all their time and energy trying to avoid challenges instead of bucking up and powering through them. Flanagan\u2019s letters are a rallying cry for toughening up and building grit. His fifteen rules provide a clear path to success in any endeavor.  Consider this book an instruction manual for getting back to the values that truly lead to success and developing the type of old school grit that will get you through anything.",

It turned out to be the right choice, as Alcindor and his teammates won an unprecedented three NCAA championship titles. But it also marked the beginning of one of the most extraordinary and enduring friendships in the history of sports. In COACH WOODEN AND ME, Abdul-Jabbar reveals the inspirational story of how his bond with John Wooden evolved from a history-making coach-player mentorship into a deep and genuine friendship that transcended sports, shaped the course of both men's lives, and lasted for half a century.COACH WOODEN AND ME is a stirring tribute to the subtle but profound influence that Wooden had on Kareem as a player, and then as a person, as they began to share their cultural, religious, and family values while facing some of life's biggest obstacles. From his first day of practice, when the players were taught the importance of putting on their athletic socks properly, to gradually absorbing the sublime wisdom of Coach Wooden's now famous \"Pyramid of Success\"; to learning to cope with the ugly racism that confronted black athletes during the turbulent Civil Rights era as well as losing loved ones, Abdul-Jabbar fondly recalls how Coach Wooden's fatherly guidance not only paved the way for his unmatched professional success but also made possible a lifetime of personal fulfillment.Full of intimate, never-before-published details and delivered with the warmth and erudition of a grateful student who has learned his lessons well, COACH WOODEN AND ME is at once a celebration of the unique philosophical outlook of college basketball's most storied coach and a moving testament to the all-conquering power of friendship.",

Even more important, he succeeded in never wavering from coaching his way, from a place of deep values. Jackson was tagged as the \u201cZen master\u201d half in jest by sportswriters, but the nickname speaks to an important truth: this is a coach who inspired, not goaded; who led by awakening and challenging the better angels of his players\u2019 nature, not their egos, fear, or greed. This is the story of a preacher\u2019s kid from North Dakota who grew up to be one of the most innovative leaders of our time. In his quest to reinvent himself, Jackson explored everything from humanistic psychology and Native American philosophy to Zen meditation. In the process, he developed a new approach to leadership based on freedom, authenticity, and selfless teamwork that turned the hypercompetitive world of professional sports on its head. In Eleven Rings, Jackson candidly describes how he:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Learned the secrets of mindfulness and team chemistry while playing for the champion New York Knicks in the 1970s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Managed Michael Jordan, the greatest player in the world, and got him to embrace selflessness, even if it meant losing a scoring title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Forged successful teams out of players of varying abilities by getting them to trust one another and perform in sync&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Inspired Dennis Rodman and other \u201cuncoachable\u201d personalities to devote themselves to something larger than themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022&nbsp; Transformed Kobe Bryant from a rebellious teenager into a mature leader of a championship team.Eleven times, Jackson led his teams to the ultimate goal: the NBA championship\u2014six times with the Chicago Bulls and five times with the Los Angeles Lakers.

The only problem: no one knew who Krzyzewski was. Nine&nbsp;days later, Jim Valvano was hired by North Carolina State to be their new head coach. The hiring didn't raise as many eyebrows, but the two new coaches had a similar goal: to unseat North Carolina's Dean Smith as the king of college basketball. And just like that, the most sensational competitive decade in history was about to unfold. In the skillful hands of John Feinstein, The Legends Club captures an era in American sport and culture, documenting the inside view of a decade of absolutely incredible competition. Feinstein pulls back the curtain on the recruiting wars, the intensely personal competition that wasn't always friendly, the enormous pressure and national stakes, and the battle for the very soul of college basketball.",

A lifelong Warriors fan turned insider Thompson is uniquely qualified to tell the definitive story of a singular talent, pulling back the curtain on the crazy work ethic and on-court intensity that make Curry great\u2014and the emphasis on family and faith that keeps him grounded.  Combining the competitive grit and fun-loving spirit of his mother with the mild demeanor, easy charm, and sharp shooting of his father, former NBA player Dell Curry, Steph Curry derives support and strength from his close-knit kin and his commitment to Christianity. This hard-working, wholesome image however is both a blessing and curse in a League of big personalities. Thompson unravels the complicated underpinnings of the Steph Curry hate with a nuanced analysis of how class and complexion come into play when a child with an NBA pedigree becomes the face of a sport traditionally honed on inner-city black top and dominated by the less privileged. With unprecedented access, Thompson draws from exclusive interviews with Steph Curry, his family, his teammates, Coach Steve Kerr, and the Warriors owners to bring readers inside the locker room and courtside with this remarkable athlete and man.",

    "description": "WE CHANGED THE GAME is a story-the real story-about the very beginning of the Indiana Pacers professional basketball team. It's about the laughable new league founded in the 1960's in which the Pacers got their start as a team, the American Basketball Association (ABA), which gave many unsung players a shot or a second chance to make it in pro basketball but faced constant struggles during its brief existence from 1967-1976 before it merged with the NBA. During those early days in the ABA league, the Indiana Pacers captured three ABA league championship titles. But also-and only known by a select few-the Pacers, and the ABA league as a whole, barely survived through some incredibly close calls and financial fiascos, facing the brink of extinction more than once. But it was with the unwavering support of Pacers fans, very creative negotiating by Pacers' co-founder and team protector Richard Tinkham, an ABA-NBA league merger, and two Indianapolis-based real estate legends that ultimately saved the ABA and secured the Pacers' future as one of the top-contending professional basketball teams in the country. The love that Indiana basketball fans had for the Pacers also triggered the explosion of downtown Indianapolis, transforming it into a vibrant, progressive state capital over these past 50 years. Through the eyes of Robin Miller, Richard Tinkham and Bob Netolicky who were there through it all, sit back and enjoy one of the most improbable and inspirational stories in professional sports history. The Pacers and the ABA league proved that with big dreams, loyalty and perseverance, even the impossible really can be possible... and ordinary people truly can change the game.",

So he found another way to channel his obsession with sports: talking trash.  In This Book Has Balls, Rapaport uses his signature smack-talk style and in-your-face humor to discuss everything from why LeBron will never be like Mike, that Tiger needs the ladies to get his golf game back, and how he once thought Mary Lou Retton was his true love. And, of course, why next year will be the year the New York Knicks win the championship. This book is a series of rants\u2014some controversial, some affectionate, but all incredibly hilarious.",

    "description": "Learn the Inspiring Story of the Milwaukee Bucks' Rising Star Giannis Antetokounmpo! Read on your PC, Mac, smartphone, tablet or Kindle device. This holiday season, if you buy the print edition as a gift, you can keep the Kindle edition for yourself! In Giannis Antetokounmpo: The Inspiring Story of One of Basketball's Rising Superstars, you will learn the inspirational story of one of basketball's most promising young stars, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Often nicknamed \"The Greek Freak\", Giannis Antetokounmpo has quickly emerged as one of the most unique players in the league today. His incredible wingspan and athleticism have made him a dominant presence on both the offensive and defensive ends of the basketball court. He is easily one of the most difficult defensive assignments for opposing teams due to his ability to not only start as a forward, but also as a guard. In just four years, Giannis Antetokounmpo has gone from averaging 6.8 points per game to 22.9 points per game. He has also quickly become the face of the Milwaukee Bucks franchise. There is still much to be unveiled in the career of Giannis Antetokounmpo. At the time of this writing, Giannis is just twenty-two years old. In this book, we'll learn more about The Greek Freak's journey into the NBA, his impact on the game, and his growing legacy as one of the best up and coming stars to make his presence known in basketball. Here is a preview of what is inside this book: Childhood and Early Life NBA Career: Getting Drafted, Rookie Season, Working Under Jason Kidd, The Largest Point Guard in the League, and Becoming an All-Star International Career Personal Life Giannis Antetokounmpo's Player Profile and Impact on Basketball Antetokounmpo's Future  An excerpt from the book: The NBA loves those rags to riches stories about how a person that lived and grew up through poverty worked his way up to get to the league, not only as an ordinary player, but a superstar ranking among the best in the world. These are the kinds of stories that makes the people adore the player and what he has been through to get to the top. More importantly, these are the stories that inspire young children to work just as hard, if not harder, than their idol to reach the success they aspire to achieve.   Several of the greatest players in league history have had to endure poverty before they found success in the NBA. Allen Iverson barely had a home growing up before he starred at Georgetown. In his MVP speech back in 2014, Kevin Durant said that his mother raised him and his brother alone while the family moved from roof to roof. The same was true for LeBron James, who was raised alone by his mother when she was still 16 years old. These players not only earned millions as NBA superstars, but have also become fan favorites because of how they worked themselves up to get to the league.  Likewise, the NBA has also found a liking for players that were seemingly genetically engineered to dominate in the game of basketball. These are the types of players that, at a glance, were naturally destined to be a great because of the physical tools they possess. If the NBA was a horse race, these kinds of players are your thoroughbreds judging by how much more physically gifted and talented they are than the rest of the competition.

For Auriemma, life affords only the briefest moments of happiness - a good round of golf, forty minutes of great basketball, a day at the beach with his family, a nice glass of wine - while disaster is seemingly always waiting to strike.

But 50 years ago it was a floor-bound game, and the opportunities it offered for African-Americans were severely limited.A key turning point was 1963, when the Loyola Ramblers of Chicago took the NCAA men\u2019s basketball title from Cincinnati, the two-time defending champions. It was one of Chicago\u2019s most memorable sports victories, but Ramblers reveals it was also a game for the history books because of the transgressive lineups fielded by both teams.Ramblers is an entertaining, detail-rich look back at the unlikely circumstances that led to Loyola\u2019s historic championship and the stories of two Loyola opponents: Cincinnati and Mississippi State. Michael Lenehan\u2019s narrative masterfully intertwines these stories in dramatic fashion, culminating with the tournament\u2019s final game, a come-from-behind overtime upset that featured two buzzer-beating shots.While on the surface this is a book about basketball, it goes deeper to illuminate how sport in America both typifies and drives change in the broader culture. The stark social realities of the times are brought vividly to life in Lenehan\u2019s telling, illustrating the challenges faced in teams\u2019 efforts simply to play their game against the worthiest opponents.",

    "description": "The definitive portrait of Kobe Bryant, from the author of Michael Jordan.  \"Lazenby's detailed research and fantastic writing paint a complex, engaging picture of one of the NBA's greats.\" (Kurt Helin, Pro Basketball Talk, NBC Sports)  Eighteen-time All-Star, scorer of 81 points in a single game, MVP, and one of the best shooting guards in NBA league history: Kobe Bryant is among basketball's absolute greatest players, and his importance to the sport is undeniable. Third on the NBA career scoring list and owner of five championship rings, he is an undisputed all-time great, one deserving of this deep and definitive biography. Even within the flashiest franchise in all of sports--the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played his entire career--Bryant always took center stage, and his final game captivated the basketball world, indeed the country. Roland Lazenby delves deep to look behind this public image, using classic basketball reporting and dozens of new interviews to reveal the whole picture, from Bryant's childhood through his playing years. Showboat is filled with large personalities and provocative stories, including details of Bryant's complicated personal life and explosive relationships on the court, and is a riveting and essential read for every hoops fan.",

It's like a nasty virus you catch from a door handle at a public toilet.No team in sports is as uniquely hated as those smug, entitled, floor-slapping, fist-pumping, insufferable Blue Devils. The loathing has almost reached the level of a religion. Christian Laettner is a punk. Amen. The Cameron Crazies are obnoxious. The Plumlees are worthless times three. Coach K is a jerk. Kumbaya. The team is dogged by an intense hatred that no other team can match\u2015and for good reason. Millions of hoops fans and March Madness aficionados around the world are not imagining things. Duke really is evil, and within the pages of Duke Sucks, Reed Tucker and Andy Bagwell show readers exactly why Duke deserves to be so detested.

    "description": "The annual NCAA Basketball Tournament, which has become known as \u201cMarch Madness\u201d has emerged as a major sports event, matched only by the Super Bowl and the Olympics. In Madness, Mark Mehler and Charles Paikert tell the stories behind the ten most compelling and memorable championship games in tournament history, from North Carolina\u2019s triple-overtime victory over Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s Kansas Wildcats in 1957 to Duke\u2019s heart stopping victory over underdog Butler in 2010. As a bonus, five more games that just missed the cut are also examined. Madness goes beyond the games to tell the the backstories of these classics, each entirely unique unto itself. For example, Jim Valvano taking his impossible dream of a national title and making it come true for the 1983 North Carolina State Wolfpack; Rollie Massimino turning spaghetti and clam sauce into inspiration for his underachieving 1985 Villanova team; and Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, breaking down in tears while taking a Broadway curtain call in front of a wildly-applauding audience who two hours earlier didn't know who these two guys were decades after their head-to-head matchup in 1979.  Some of these stories also resonate far beyond the basketball court, including the 1966 triumph by the Texas Western Miners, which helped chisel away the college basketball color line and stamped their victory as \"Glory Road.\" Over sixty years of college basketball history is brought to life in this must-have for all basketball fans.",

A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.The New York Times bestseller, now with a new introduction! The Breaks of the Game focuses on one grim season (1979-80) in the life of the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers, a team that only three years before had been NBA champions.The tactile authenticity of Halberstam's knowledge of the basketball world is unrivaled. Yet he is writing here about far more than just basketball. This is a story about a place in our society where power, money, and talent collide and sometimes corrupt, a place where both national obsessions and naked greed are exposed. It's about the influence of big media, the fans and the hype they subsist on, the clash of ethics, the terrible physical demands of modern sports (from drugs to body size), the unreal salaries, the conflicts of race and class, and the consequences of sport converted into mass entertainment and athletes transformed into superstars--all presented in a way that puts the reader in the room and on the court, and The Breaks of the Game in a league of its own.",

    "product_name": "Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich",
    "description": "Pistol is more than the biography of a ballplayer. It's the stuff of classic novels: the story of a boy transformed by his father's dream\u2014and the cost of that dream. Even as Pete Maravich became Pistol Pete\u2014a basketball icon for baby boomers\u2014all the Maraviches paid a price. Now acclaimed author Mark Kriegel has brilliantly captured the saga of an American family: its rise, its apparent ruin, and, finally, its redemption.Almost four decades have passed since Maravich entered the national consciousness as basketball's boy wizard. No one had ever played the game like the kid with the floppy socks and shaggy hair. And all these years later, no one else ever has. The idea of Pistol Pete continues to resonate with young people today just as powerfully as it did with their fathers. In averaging 44.2 points a game at Louisiana State University, he established records that will never be broken. But even more enduring than the numbers was the sense of ecstasy and artistry with which he played. With the ball in his hands, Maravich had a singular power to inspire awe, inflict embarrassment, or even tell a joke. But he wasn't merely a mesmerizing showman. He was basketball's answer to Elvis, a white Southerner who sold Middle America on a black man's game. Like Elvis, he paid a terrible price, becoming a prisoner of his own fame. Set largely in the South, Kriegel's Pistol, a tale of obsession and basketball, fathers and sons, merges several archetypal characters. Maravich was a child prodigy, a prodigal son, his father's ransom in a Faustian bargain, and a Great White Hope. But he was also a creature of contradictions: always the outsider but a virtuoso in a team sport, an exuberant showman who wouldn't look you in the eye, a vegetarian boozer, an athlete who lived like a rock star, a suicidal genius saved by Jesus Christ. A renowned biographer\u2014People magazine called him \u201ca master\u201d\u2014Kriegel renders his subject with a style that is, by turns, heartbreaking, lyrical, and electric. The narrative begins in 1929, the year a missionary gave Pete's father a basketball. Press Maravich had been a neglected child trapped in a hellish industrial town, but the game enabled him to blossom. It also caused him to confuse basketball with salvation. The intensity of Press's obsession initiates a journey across three generations of Maraviches. Pistol Pete, a ballplayer unlike any other, was a product of his father's vanity and vision. But that dream continues to exact a price on Pete's own sons. Now in their twenties\u2014and fatherless for most of their lives\u2014they have waged their own struggles with the game and its ghosts. Pistol is an unforgettable biography. By telling one family's history, Kriegel has traced the history of the game and a large slice of the American narrative.",

In the early 1930s, during the worst drought and financial depression in American history, Sam Babb began to dream. Like so many others, this charismatic Midwestern basketball coach wanted a reason to have hope. Traveling from farm to farm near the tiny Oklahoma college where he coached, Babb recruited talented, hardworking young women and offered them a chance at a better life: a free college education in exchange for playing on his basketball team, the Cardinals. &nbsp; Despite their fears of leaving home and the sacrifices that their families would face, the women joined the team. And as Babb coached the Cardinals, something extraordinary happened. These remarkable athletes found a passion for the game and a heartfelt loyalty to one another and their coach--and they began to win. Combining exhilarating sports writing and exceptional storytelling, Dust Bowl Girls takes readers on the Cardinals\u2019 intense, improbable journey all the way to an epic showdown with the prevailing national champions, helmed by the legendary Babe Didrikson. Lydia Reeder captures a moment in history when female athletes faced intense scrutiny from influential figures in politics, education, and medicine who denounced women\u2019s sports as unhealthy and unladylike.

Dean Oliver highlights general strategies for teams when they\u2019re winning or losing and what aspects should be the focus in either situation. He describes and quantifies the jobs of team leaders and role players, then discusses the interactions between players and how to achieve the best fit. Oliver conceptualizes the meaning of teamwork and how to quantify the value of different types of players working together. He examines historically successful NBA teams and identifies what made them so successful: individual talent, a system of putting players together, or good coaching. Oliver then uses these statistical tools and case studies to evaluate the best players in history, such as Magic Johnson, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Charles Barkley and how they contributed to their teams\u2019 success. He does the same for some of the NBA\u2019s \"oddball\" players-Manute Bol, Muggsy Bogues, and Dennis Rodman and for the WNBA\u2019s top players. Basketball on Paper is unique in its incorporation of business and analytical concepts within the context of basketball to measure the value of players in a cooperative setting.

It was founded in a bizarre but momentous \"Land Run\" in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team\u2019s 2012-13 season, when the Thunder\u2019s brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game.

    "description": "Unlike the stories of most visible Division I college athletes, Amanda Ottaway s story has more in common with those of the 80 percent of college athletes who are never seen on TV. The Rebounders follows the college career of an average NCAA Division I women s basketball player in the twenty-first century, beginning with the recruiting process when Ottaway is an eager, naive teenager and ending when she's a more contemplative twentysomething alumna. Ottaway's story, along with the journeys of her dynamic Wildcat teammates at Davidson College in North Carolina, covers in engaging detail the life of a mid-major athlete: recruitment, the preseason, body image and eating disorders, schoolwork, family relationships, practice, love life, team travel, game day, injuries, drug and alcohol use, coaching changes, and what comes after the very last game. In addition to the everyday issues of being a student athlete, The Rebounders also covers the objectification of female athletes, race, sexuality, and self-expression. Most college athletes, famous or not, play hard, get hurt, fail, and triumph together in a profound love of their sport and one another, and then their careers end and they figure out how to move on. From concussions and minor injuries to classrooms, parties, and relationships, Ottaway understands the experience of a Division I women s basketball player firsthand.The Rebounders&nbsp;is, at its core, a feminist coming-of-age story, an exploration of what it means to be a young woman who loves a sport and is on a course of self-discovery through that medium.",

    "description": "Author, Mark Montieth spent decades researching this book through extensive interviews and access to previously unseen internal documents regarding the formation and early seasons of the Indiana Pacers in 1967. He tells the dramatic story of the noble, city-wide effort to establish the franchise after a 14-year hiatus from professional basketball in Indianapolis, as well as the tumultuous and electrifying early seasons when the franchise that thrives today first took root.More than merely recounting the games, he delves into the unique personalities of some of the players and the social issues that influenced their careers. He also captures the carefree, raucous nature of professional basketball in a basketball-crazed state in the Sixties. This was an era when fights in games were common, a player could pack a gun in carry-on luggage for a road trip, newspapers unabashedly promoted the team to help assure its survival, games were played in arenas so cold the players could see their breath, a player could be told he was traded while taking a post-game shower and fans would run onto the court and attack a referee after a game.The Pacers would go on to win three championships in the American Basketball Association, and their popularity would play a critical role in revitalizing downtown Indianapolis by establishing the need for a new arena. This book sets the stage for that era by exploring the difficult birth of the franchise and the fateful events that enabled it. It is illustrated with numerous photos, many never seen by the public.",

    "description": "I was dead for thirty seconds.That's what the cop in Fall River told me. When the EMTs found me, there was a needle in my arm and a packet of heroin in the front seat.At basketball-crazy Durfee High School in Fall River, Massachusetts, junior guard Chris Herren carried his family's and the city's dreams on his skinny frame. His grandfather, father, and older brother had created their own sports legends in a declining city; he was the last, best hope for a career beyond the shuttered mills and factories. Herren was heavily recruited by major universities, chosen as a McDonald's All-American, featured in a Sports Illustrated cover story, and at just seventeen years old became the central figure in Fall River Dreams, an acclaimed book about the 1994 Durfee team's quest for the state championship.  Leaving Fall River for college, Herren starred on Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State Bulldogs team of talented misfits, which included future NBA players as well as future convicted felons. His gritty, tattooed, hip-hop persona drew the ire of rival fans and more national attention: Rolling Stone profiled him, 60 Minutes interviewed him, and the Denver Nuggets drafted him. When the Boston Celtics acquired his contract, he lived the dream of every Massachusetts kid\u2015but off the court Herren was secretly crumbling, as his alcohol and drug use escalated and his life spiraled out of control. Twenty years later, Chris Herren was married to his high-school sweetheart, the father of three young children, and a heroin junkie. His basketball career was over, consumed by addictions; he had no job, no skills, and was a sadly familiar figure to those in Fall River who remembered him as a boy, now prowling the streets he once ruled, looking for a fix. One day, for a time he cannot remember, he would die.  In his own words, Chris Herren tells how he nearly lost everything and everyone he loved, and how he found a way back to life. Powerful, honest, and dramatic, Basketball Junkie is a remarkable memoir, harrowing in its descent, and heartening in its return.",

    "description": "The legend. In his own words.   From the poverty-stricken streets of Sao Paulo to an international icon and one of the most celebrated footballers of all time, Pele's life story is as extraordinary as it is enrapturing. With his trademark wit and deference, the legend draws us into a wonderful story lit by insight and humour and encompassing everything you ever wanted to know about the great man himself.   From shining shoes for extra pennies at the Baru Athletic Club to triumph in several World Cups, the glory of being on top of the world -- and staying there -- is shared in what is undoubtedly one of the must-read autobiographies of the year. On top of his athletic achievements, Pele has also been a staunch campaigner for human rights and in particular the plight of street children in his home country, leading to an appointment as a UN Ambassador and an honorary knighthood from the British monarchy.   By turns addictive, moving and enlightening, this is the ultimate story of the rise of a star and an amazing testimony to how even the lowliest of society's people can reach the dizzying heights of worldwide adoration and success.",

    "product_name": "Basketball Analytics: Objective and Efficient Strategies for Understanding How Teams Win",
    "description": "Basketball Analytics is a must-read for any sports analytics enthusiast or student of the game of basketball. Authors Stephen Shea, Ph.D. (Professor of Mathematics) and Christopher Baker (Software Engineer) utilize their unique skill-set to introduce original metrics for analyzing player performance, team style and team construction in the NBA. While demonstrating an awareness of the industry\u2019s best ideas, the authors present original, objective and efficient strategies for understanding how teams win. New player performance statistics include Offensive Efficiency (OE), Efficient Offensive Production (EOP), Defensive Stops Gained (DSG), and Approximate Value (AV). OE reflects a player\u2019s ability to make the most fundamental offensive decisions. EOP adjusts a player\u2019s points and assists based on his efficiency. DSG gives a complete measure of a player\u2019s defensive contributions, without relying on individual player statistics like blocks and steals. AV is a measure of total player performance that rivals any publicly available statistic. Basketball Analytics introduces groundbreaking metrics on player involvement in the offense. Point, Rebound and Assist Balance aggregate player usage in these critical statistics. New studies on the NBA show whether teams should strive for balance or unbalance. An NBA draft pick value study determines the average value of each pick and the likelihood of landing a star or role player with each draft position. The results of this study are used to discuss topics including the biggest draft blunders and steals, the draft success of each NBA team, and the quality of each draft class dating back to 1977. This valuable understanding of the NBA Draft creates a foundation for discussing various approaches to team development and construction. Additionally, the authors discuss redefining the positions on the court, unpredictability in the game, data visualization, and applications of spatial tracking technology. There are many intensely debated questions surrounding the NBA today. Who are the most valuable players, and how do they compare to past greats? Which players have the greatest impact on their team\u2019s defense? Should Kobe Bryant be concerned with getting his teammates involved in the offense? How do offenses differ in the clutch, and which players thrive in these situations? How difficult is it for a team to rebuild through the draft? Basketball Analytics introduces new statistics and new concepts to explore these questions and more.",

More than 30 years after he left Louisiana State University, his NCAA scoring record still stands. He enjoyed fame, wealth, and short of winning an NBA championship, achieved every possible success. But there was a price. Pete brought a childlike exuberance to the court that often masked a tortured and confused adult. Things changed dramatically and permanently, however, when Pete found Christ. At last he experienced peace and a purpose that extended beyond the basketball court. He became an avid student of the Bible and a tireless evangelist. Tragically, at age 40, Pete Maravich died.

    "description": "A memoir by the NBA Hall of Fame player, active from 1977-1993 and widely regarded as one of the all-time great New York Knicks. NBA Hall of Famer Bernard King is one of the most dynamic scorers in basketball history. King was notoriously private as a player, and rarely spoke to the press-not about his career and never about his personal life. And even beyond his prolific scoring, King will forever be remembered for the gruesome knee injury he suffered in 1985. Doctors who told him he'd never play again were shocked when he not only became the first player to return to the NBA from a torn ACL, but returned at an All Star level. In Game Face, King finally opens up about his life on and off the court. In his book, King's basketball I.Q. is on full display as he breaks down defenses using his own unique system for taking shots from predetermined spots on the floor. King talks about matching up against some of the all-time NBA greats, from Michael Jordan, Julius Erving and Charles Barkley to Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing and many others. He also tackles issues of race and family off the court, as well as breaking a personal cycle of negativity and self-destructiveness with the help of his family. Engaging, shocking, revelatory, yet always positive and upbeat, Bernard King's memoir appeals to multiple generations of basketball fans.",

He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrifice\u2014and pioneering surgery\u2014he recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir. Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Wooden\u2019s death at age ninety-nine. Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended. He eventually won an Emmy Award and other accolades for broadcasting and was recognized as a leading media pundit. John Wooden once said that no greatness ever came without sacrifice. Nothing better illustrates this saying than the real story of Walton\u2019s life. In his own words, Back from the Dead shares this dramatic story, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, his many setbacks and rebounds, and his ultimate triumph as the toughest of champions.",

    "product_name": "Alley-Oop to Aliyah: African American Hoopsters in the Holy Land",
    "description": "Every season, dozens of African American basketball players pack up their sneakers to play and live in Israel. They eat Israeli food, navigate Israeli hustle and bustle, experience cultural and religious customs in the world\u2019s only Jewish country, and voluntarily expose themselves to the omnipresent threat of violence in the volatile Middle East. Some players are both Black and Jewish by birth. Others choose to convert to Judaism while residing in Israel. Some go so far as to obtain Israeli citizenship, enlist in the Israeli Army, marry Israeli women, and stay long after their playing careers end. Alley-Oop to Aliyah: African American Hoopsters in the Holy Land, is the first book to provide an in-depth exploration and analysis of the experiences of African American basketball players in Israel from the 1970s till today. Author David A. Goldstein examines how they end up in the country in the first place, the multitude of distinctive aspects of their lives there, the challenges and difficulties they face, and the reasons some choose to return to Israel year after year. In some cases they even decide to stay in Israel permanently. Alley-Oop to Aliyah not only deals with basketball and its impact on Israel, but it delves into emotion-laden issues of race, religion, identity, and politics, primarily through the eyes of the players themselves, based on more than forty extensive first-person interviews Goldstein, a sports journalist of half-Israeli descent, conducted. Their stories and their impact on Israel are at the very heart of this revealing book that is about more than just a game.",

The NCAA championship game played that day launched an epic rivalry between two exceptional players: Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Larry Bird. Though they played each other only once as college athletes, that game transformed the NCAA tournament into a multibillion-dollar enterprise and laid the foundation for the resurgence of the NBA.

Davis also tells the stories of their remarkable coaches, Jud Heathcote and Bill Hodges, and he shows how tensions over race and class heightened the drama of the competition.Davis combed through several years' worth of newspaper and magazine coverage, interviewed nearly one hundred people, and watched dozens of games to reconstruct the colorful, historic, and improbable narrative of how Larry Bird and Magic Johnson burst on the scene\u2015a coming-of-age story that continues to resonate.

Combine a twelve-year NBA career with a College Football Hall of Fame career and the portrait of a humble, magnanimous leader takes shape.The Athlete is the first definitive biography of Charlie Ward.

    "description": "\"If you are interested in Coaching the System, you must be either desperate or crazy!\" At least that's what people told authors Gary Smith and Doug Porter when they began investigating this revolutionary style of play almost a decade ago. Ignoring the critics, they went on to coach the two highest scoring teams in men's and women's college basketball history: the University of Redlands, California (132.4 ppg), and Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois (104.1 ppg). From its origins as the Sonny Allen Numbered Fast Break, to Paul Westhead\u2019s Loyola Marymount up-tempo game, the System has been around for decades. But when Grinnell College\u2019s David Arseneault added platoon substitution patterns and hockey-style short shifts, placing a priority on creating three-point looks for his \u201cpreferred shooters,\u201d the System truly came into its own. Smith and Porter learned the Grinnell version of the System from Arseneault himself, adapting it to fit their situations coaching men\u2019s and women\u2019s programs. In the past decade their teams set 32 NCAA and NAIA records between them, including most 100-point games in a season (Redlands-23; Olivet-24). Olivet also holds national records for defensive turnovers (36.3 per game) assists (23.8 per game), and three pointers made in a season (509, 15.6 per game). Redlands owns college basketball records (all levels) for field goal attempts (110.3 per game), and three-pointers made (23.8 per game). Now you can learn every detail of this devastating full court run-and-press attack that allows you to dictate tempo and force your opponents out of their normal game plan, capturing the imagination of your players and community, and making coaching fun again! You\u2019ll learn exactly how and why the System works, how to adapt it to fit your personnel, suggestions for conditioning players, organizing System practices, and even ways to respond to the inevitable criticisms that come with playing the game this far \u201coutside the box.\u201d Other chapters offer complete descriptions of the Redlands Attack (Coach Smith\u2019s variation of the Grinnell offense), the LMU Attack (which Westhead popularized and used to advance to the NCAA regional finals in 1990), and the Olivet Attack (Coach Porter\u2019s hybrid version of the LMU and Dribble-Drive offenses). Finally, you'll learn System defensive principles, terminology, and how to cover every conceivable press attack and press-breaker alignment. Also included are 57 drills and over 300 diagrams to illustrate System offense and defense, providing you with a complete blueprint for \u201cCoaching the System!\u201d",

A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of James Naismith, the game's inventor, McLendon taught his team to play the full-court press and run a fast break that no one could catch. His Eagles would become the highest-scoring college team in America--a basketball juggernaut that shattered its opponents by as many as sixty points per game. Yet his players faced danger whenever they traveled backcountry roads.Across town, at Duke University, the best basketball squad on campus wasn't the Blue Devils, but an all-white military team from the Duke medical school. Composed of former college stars from across the country, the team dismantled everyone they faced, including the Duke varsity. They were prepared to take on anyone--until an audacious invitation arrived, one that was years ahead of anything the South had ever seen before. What happened next wasn't on anyone's schedule. Based on years of research, The Secret Game is a story of courage and determination, and of an incredible, long-buried moment in the nation's sporting past. The riveting, true account of a remarkable season, it is the story of how a group of forgotten college basketball players, aided by a pair of refugees from Nazi Germany and a group of daring student activists, not only blazed a trail for a new kind of America, but helped create one of the most meaningful moments in basketball history.",

    "description": "The definitive primer on the world\u2019s most popular shoe: the basketball sneaker. Basketball shoes have a long and storied history both on and off the court. Back in the 1930s, a basketball sneaker was created for straight-up performance. Today, hoops footwear do double duty: they\u2019re designed for and by elite players, but to sneakerheads, how they look is nearly as important as how they perform. SLAM Kicks breaks down the path of the basketball sneaker, from the birth of the very first iconic shoe, the Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star, to the white-hot best-selling cultural-phenomenon Nike Air Jordan sneaker line. This book showcases the hottest basketball kicks over time, throwbacks and new shoes alike, covering each legendary sneaker and its design, the technical advancements found in the shoe, the athletes who made the shoe famous, and the cultural waves the footwear has made off the basketball court. Featured sneakers also include the Adidas Jabbar, the Puma Clyde, the Nike Air Force One, the Reebok Question, the AND1 Tai Chi, the Nike Zoom Kobe IV, and many others. SLAM Kicks: Basketball Sneakers That Changed the Game is the perfect gift for basketball-sneaker fans and street-fashion enthusiasts alike.",

What was needed was an indoor wintertime game that combined recreation and competition. One evening he worked out the fundamentals of a game that would quickly catch on. Two peach half-bushel baskets gave the name to the brand new sport in late 1891.&nbsp;Basketball: Its Origin and Development was written by the inventor himself, who was inspired purely by the joy of play. Naismith, born in northern Ontario in 1861, gave up the ministry to preach clean living through sport. He describes Duck on the Rock, a game from his Canadian childhood, the creative reasoning behind his basket game, the eventual refinement of rules and development of equipment, the spread of amateur and professional teams throughout the world, and the growth of women\u2019s basketball (at first banned to male spectators because the players wore bloomers). Naismith lived long enough to see basketball included in the Olympics in 1936. Three years later he died, after nearly forty years as head of the physical education department at the University of Kansas.",

Now, in an inspirational and entertaining rebuttal, the legendary basketball coach Bob Knight explains why \"negative thinking\" will actually produce more positive results, in sports and in daily life. Coach Knight, the second-winningest coach in NCAA history with 902 victories, explains that victory is often attained by the team that makes the fewest mistakes. His coaching philosophy was to instill discipline by \"preparing to win\" rather than hoping to win. That meant understanding the downside and drilling his teams to prevent the things that could go wrong. And when his teams did win, he made sure they didn\u2019t dwell on their success, but rather looked immediately to the challenges of the next game. He applies this lesson to business strategy as well.",

While no coach treasures a win more than John, this terrific book reveals his greater purpose\u2014to lead his young players to better lives, and then challenge them to give back to others.\" \u2014President William J. Clinton&nbsp;In Players First, John Calipari relates for the first time anywhere his experiences over his first four years coaching the Kentucky Wildcats, college basketball\u2019s most fabled program, from the doldrums to a national championship, drawing lessons about leadership, character, and the path to personal and collective victory.At its core, Calipari\u2019s coaching philosophy centers on keeping his focus on the players\u2014what they need to get the best out of themselves and one another. He is beloved by his players for being utterly honest with them and making promises that he always keeps, no matter what. He knows that in this age, they come to Kentucky to prepare for the NBA; every year he gets players who in a previous era would have gone directly into the pros from high school but now have to play college basketball for one year. Calipari has fought against this system, but he has to play within it, and so he does, better than anyone.The result is an extraordinary leadership challenge: every year Coach Cal gets a handful of eighteen-year-old kids who have been in a bubble for the previous four years at least, filled with hype about their own greatness, and they come to Kentucky feeling sure that they will play for their coach only for seven months before they go on to greater glory. Every year, he has to reinvent his team. After his 2012 NCAA championship, it was particularly dramatic; he lost his first six players in the first round, meaning that someone who couldn\u2019t even start for Kentucky was a first-round draft pick.The overall record at Kentucky, and for his career, puts Calipari in the pantheon of the greatest coaches in the history of the game. Bold, funny, and truthful, like Coach Calipari himself, Players First is truly the first deep reckoning with the meaning of his experiences and the gifts of insight they offer.",

    "product_name": "Glory Hounds: How a Small Northwest School Reshaped College Basketball. And Itself.",
    "description": "Almost a generation ago, a small school from the Northwest made its first noise in college basketball. For the first time, the Gonzaga Bulldogs won games in the NCAA tournament of 1999, going all the way to the Elite Eight. Then they validated their arrival with Sweet 16 appearances the next two years. Unlike other unheralded programs that have emerged to make national headlines, the Zags didn\u2019t go away. They have stacked solid season upon solid season and as they enter 2016-17, they boast an 18-year streak of playing in the NCAA tournament -- a run of success that includes eight straight years of March Madness victories. A few years after the men\u2019s program took off, the Gonzaga women also reached unprecedented heights -- partly with the help of a fan base that couldn\u2019t get tickets to the men\u2019s games, but pushed the women to a top-15 national ranking in attendance. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the story of how it all came together at Gonzaga for both men and women, how it changed the school, and how -- in a turbulent time of here-and-gone players in college basketball -- it continues. The Gonzaga story is woven deeply into the longevity of head coach Mark Few and his choice to stay at the school in the face of multiple offers to move elsewhere. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d takes a close look at Few, his small-town roots and his decision to stay put. The book explores the rise of Few\u2019s longtime assistant, Tommy Lloyd, and his recruiting acumen overseas that has made Gonzaga one of the most popular destinations for foreign players. It documents the almost zany events that led to the construction of a new arena on campus in 2004; the unforgettable season of Adam Morrison in 2006; and the heartbreak and redemption of Josh Heytvelt. It chronicles the redshirt-year growth that has aided the program, and it details the paradox that keeps Seattle from becoming a productive recruiting pool for the Zags. Gonzaga\u2019s women authored their own rise to prominence, and \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d recounts that ascent, as well as the wizardry of the best women\u2019s player in school history, Courtney Vandersloot. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the first attempt to bind together the various elements that, in a span now stretching into a generation, have made the Gonzaga story so compelling.",

    "product_name": "Glory Hounds: How a Small Northwest School Reshaped College Basketball. And Itself.",
    "description": "Almost a generation ago, a small school from the Northwest made its first noise in college basketball. For the first time, the Gonzaga Bulldogs won games in the NCAA tournament of 1999, going all the way to the Elite Eight. Then they validated their arrival with Sweet 16 appearances the next two years. Unlike other unheralded programs that have emerged to make national headlines, the Zags didn\u2019t go away. They have stacked solid season upon solid season and as they enter 2016-17, they boast an 18-year streak of playing in the NCAA tournament -- a run of success that includes eight straight years of March Madness victories. A few years after the men\u2019s program took off, the Gonzaga women also reached unprecedented heights -- partly with the help of a fan base that couldn\u2019t get tickets to the men\u2019s games, but pushed the women to a top-15 national ranking in attendance. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the story of how it all came together at Gonzaga for both men and women, how it changed the school, and how -- in a turbulent time of here-and-gone players in college basketball -- it continues. The Gonzaga story is woven deeply into the longevity of head coach Mark Few and his choice to stay at the school in the face of multiple offers to move elsewhere. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d takes a close look at Few, his small-town roots and his decision to stay put. The book explores the rise of Few\u2019s longtime assistant, Tommy Lloyd, and his recruiting acumen overseas that has made Gonzaga one of the most popular destinations for foreign players. It documents the almost zany events that led to the construction of a new arena on campus in 2004; the unforgettable season of Adam Morrison in 2006; and the heartbreak and redemption of Josh Heytvelt. It chronicles the redshirt-year growth that has aided the program, and it details the paradox that keeps Seattle from becoming a productive recruiting pool for the Zags. Gonzaga\u2019s women authored their own rise to prominence, and \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d recounts that ascent, as well as the wizardry of the best women\u2019s player in school history, Courtney Vandersloot. \u201cGlory Hounds\u201d is the first attempt to bind together the various elements that, in a span now stretching into a generation, have made the Gonzaga story so compelling.",

    "description": "For twelve years the women\u2019s basketball rivalry between UConn and Tennessee was the most iconic matchup in women\u2019s sports. Even now, twenty years since the annual series started, the competition between these two storied programs still provokes heated argument and bitter resentment. Led by Hall of Fame coaches Geno Auriemma and Pat Summitt, UConn and Tennessee combined for nine national championships, with the UConn Huskies winning five\u2014including four against the Tennessee Lady Vols. In all, UConn won thirteen of twenty-two matchups during the rivalry, and along the way the two coaches\u2014with distinctive and brash personalities and a shared determination to rule their sport\u2014clashed privately and publicly, generating enough heat to make women\u2019s basketball relevant in the national sports landscape as never before.On the court, the two teams produced a series of memorable games, from overtime thrillers to timeless classics that defined the sport. Off the court, the coaches\u2019 encounters were often marked by their seemingly genuine dislike for each other, until the conflict reached a breaking point in 2007 and Summitt stunned the basketball world by canceling the series for reasons neither side has ever revealed.Now, eight years after the last game, Unrivaled uncovers the on-court and behind-the-scenes story of this intensely personal rivalry between coaches, players, and the two most passionate fan bases women\u2019s sports has ever known.&nbsp;",

This holiday season, if you buy the print edition as a gift, you can keep the Kindle edition for yourself! In Gregg Popovich: The Inspiring Life and Leadership Lessons of One of Basketball's Greatest Coaches, you will learn the inspirational story of one of basketball's premier coaches, Gregg Popovich. Popovich has steered the ship for the San Antonio Spurs franchise to multiple championships and perennial playoff contention. Despite having to navigate several key personnel changes over the years, Pop has demonstrated a truly unique ability to adapt to the direction of the game. When he retires from coaching, Pop will go down as one of the greatest coaches of all time. There are a number of key leadership lessons that can be learned from Pop, such as getting the right players on your team, maximizing the potential of each individual player, and remaining a stern disciplinarian to earn the trust and respect of your team. Here is a preview of what is inside this book:  Background Story NBA Coaching Career Building the Spurs Dynasty The Gregg Popovich System How Gregg Popovich Maximizes Player Talent Gregg Popovich, the Leader Key Takeaways Conclusion and Gregg Popovich's Legacy  An excerpt from the book: Much like how soldiers are the reasons why countries win battles, players are the reasons why NBA teams win games on the hardwood floor. The countless hours they put into honing and crafting their game in the gym and weight room contributes to how they affect the outcome of games. They sacrifice and pour out their sweat, tears, and even blood for the purpose of giving wins to their teams and fans.   But while NBA games are won by the players on the floor, preparation and strategy have always been the keys to winning championships. Soldiers may be the reasons why battles are won, but wars are won outside of the battlefield. And in the NBA, players may be the reasons why teams win games, but championships are won by the leadership of their coaches. And when it comes down to coaching, one would be hard-pressed to find someone better than Gregg Popovich in that department.   There have been many great coaches that have become legendary names in the history of the NBA. There was Red Auerbach, who was a revolutionary at making his team focus on making each other better on his way to nine NBA championships during the 60's era of the league. While relying on Bill Russell's leadership on the floor, the Boston Celtics were winning titles and dominating in a less competitive era because of how Auerbach instilled in them the basics and fundamentals of team play.  Decades later, Pat Riley would make the Los Angeles Lakers the best show on the planet by running a fast-paced system that relied on the fastbreak and passing skills of Magic Johnson. Riley would win four titles with the Lakers back in the 80's and would later win one again with the Miami Heat in 2006 at the tail end of his coaching career.

    "product_name": "21st Century Guide to Individual Skill Development",
    "description": "21st Century Guide to Individual Skill Development is the player's version of The 21st Century Basketball Practice, but can be used by coaches or skill trainers as a complement to The 21st Century Basketball Practice. The philosophy and concepts between the two books are the same, but this book focuses on individual skill development, specifically shooting, finishing, and dribbling. The book contains a chapter about the specific skills, but the book is centered on strategies to improve your individual practice. McCormick outlines and explains various strategies that worked for him as a player, coach, and skill trainer, and that are supported, in most cases, by research. In addition to his personal examples and research, McCormick includes examples from modern-day superstars such as Stephen Curry and his visit to an NBA team's offseason workouts. This book is about individual practice and skill development, but individual skill is a misnomer. Games are complex. There is no isolated or individual skill: All skills are interdependent. Despite the interdependence of skills, players do and should practice individually. This book provides strategies to enhance the effectiveness of individual practice, and offers advice on skill development hacks off the court, the usefulness of private coaches, and the value of play, pickup games, and collective skill development. McCormick's philosophy centers on a few important concepts: Technique and skill are different; complex and hard describe different things; training and learning are not synonymous; intrinsic motivation is vital; and constant feedback interrupts learning. The specific strategies fit within this philosophy and describe different approaches for skill development, whether by oneself, with a private coach, or with a training group. The objective is to give players the tools and ideas to improve their individual practice and offseason training to maximize their skill development.",

After playing his college ball at Penn State, Tyler Smith had a path in mind of where he wanted his pro basketball career to lead. Bringing his own toilet paper to away games, courts made of concrete, and fully-geared riot police at every stadium were not part of his original dream.  Where were all the big contracts people talked about? Would he even have a job next season\u2015or next week? And would he be playing for free this month because the team didn\u2019t feel like paying him? In this highly unstable and unorthodox overseas lifestyle as a professional basketball player, Smith draws readers in quickly with his humor and ability to share his clever stories that seem outrageous, but are 100 percent true. His attitude and faith are tested relentlessly through bounced paychecks, injuries, and the seemingly endless frustrating reality of people around him speaking a language he could not understand. From Italy to Japan to Uruguay, and even the NBA, the challenges and adventures only accelerate as Tyler\u2019s wife and kids are added to the overseas equation. His unique story is highly engaging whether or not you\u2019re a basketball junkie.

In it he shares his most treasured memories and never-before-seen photographs as he looks back on an extraordinary life on and off the court. Hailed by many as the greatest coach in the history of American sports, John Wooden is as famous for his personal philosophy as he is for his career achievements. He inspired, guided, and motivated generations of fans with his bestselling books on leadership, values, family, and the true meaning of success.

Here was the seemingly unbeatable Duke Blue Devils pitted against the first-time finalist Connecticut Huskies, and at stake was the ultimate crown: the National Championship. On that unforgettable night in St. Petersburg, Jim Calhoun and his amazing team wrote a new chapter in the storied history of the UConn Huskies program, putting the perfect exclamation point on a season to remember.But behind the high drama that fateful night in Florida lay an even more fascinating tale of one man's rise to college basketball preeminence. In Dare to Dream, the Huskies iron-willed coach, Jim Calhoun, for the first time shares his own story about his inspirational family and the tragedies they faced; about his early successful years at Northeastern, where he began to compile the first half of a unique double (he's the only coach to have won at least 250 games at two different Division I schools); and about his assumption of ultimate responsibility at the sleeping giant in Storrs, Connecticut.Along the way, Jim Calhoun paints fascinating portraits of the players who have done battle for him, and of the unsung heroes behind the scenes whose hard work and dedication to Connecticut basketball have kept the dream alive. In just thirteen years, Jim Calhoun has turned the Huskies into one of the leading basketball programs in the country, and in this moving, funny, and inspiring book, he takes us behind the scenes to show us just how he did it.From the Hardcover edition.",

In Brad Stevens: The Inspiring Life and Leadership Lessons of One of Basketball's Greatest Young Coaches, you will learn the story of one of basketball's young star coaches, Brad Stevens. Since joining the Celtics organization in the summer of 2013, Brad Stevens has led the resurgence of the Celtics in the Eastern Conference. Stevens has demonstrated impressive leadership in his ability to quickly build rapport with many different personalities and to create a sustainable system of success. While he is still early in his coaching career, Brad Stevens has quickly become one of the most sought after coaches in the NBA. There are a number of key leadership lessons that can be learned from Stevens, such as instilling a strong work ethic, believing in your organizational philosophy, and fostering a growth mindset. Whether you're a basketball player or a coach looking for inspiration, this book will help you discover the incredible story of Brad Stevens and the many leadership lessons that can be learned from studying his success. Here is a preview of what is inside this book:  Background and History Coaching at Butler What Makes Brad Stevens a Good Leader How Brad Stevens Maximizes Player Talent Brad Stevens' System Key Takeaways in Work Ethic, Believing in the Organizational Philosophy, and the Growth Mindset Conclusion  An excerpt from the book: They say that being a coach is about having the experience of being able to play and experience what it is like to be on an NBA court where basketball is played at its highest level. It is always different when you have experienced the hard grind and difficulty of going through an NBA season, and then you try to preach it to players that are also trying to carve out their NBA careers.  Some of the more successful players turned NBA coaches include the 11-time NBA champion coach Phil Jackson, who was part of the 1972-73 championship roster of the New York Knicks. He would soon become an assistant for the Chicago Bulls in the 80's before he took the reins as the head coach and won six titles for them in the 90's. He then would win five more titles for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2000's era.  Many other former NBA players that have found themselves coaching teams in the big league. These include Bill Russell (who once played for the Celtics, but ended up coaching them after), Larry Bird (who played for Boston but coached the Pacers later on), and Doc Rivers (who was a key part of the Hawks in the 80's and won a title with the Celtics as a coach). Byron Scott was a key member of the Showtime Lakers, who would coach the New Orleans Hornets and the Lakers soon afterward, among others.   It is those coaches' experience as NBA players that have provided the knowledge and know-how they needed to become successful in their endeavors as strategists in the league. Their personnel can relate to what they have experienced as former players, and that is an aspect of coaching that has been difficult to replace. They know what it takes to manage a grinding NBA season and probably even a title run.

Basketball serves as the way of unpacking the greater story, a behind the scenes journey that provides a privileged glimpse into the hearts of 15 young men, three coaches, two managers, trainer, and a cast of colorful small-town characters as the teams strive to win the CCAA and Division II National Championship. Through the Red Door is the first book ever written about the world of Division II college basketball. The book reveals the story of how Coach Clink turned an underfunded program that had been struggling on both the court and in the classroom into an elite Division II program that that has reached the NCAA Championship Tournament Elite Eight twice in the last four years and made the NCAA Championship Tournament six seasons straight. More importantly, Coach Clink\u2019s players have a graduation rate that is well above 80% while the overall graduation rate for Division II college basketball players is 46% for student-athletes who entered the university as freshman. As the banged-up red door on the cover of the book metaphorically portrays, the young men in this book both literally and figuratively move through the door and go beyond. The reader learns how Coach Clink built his program by establishing a culture where redshirting is the norm, a culture that amplifies the value of work, cohesion, family, and integrity. Coach Clink instills the timeless fundamentals of life that translate to any aspect of life \u2014 whether it is a classroom or corporate conference room \u2014 assisting his players to sharpen leadership traits.",

    "description": "The DREAM TEAM was a bunch of kids from Akron, Ohio-LeBron James and his best friends-who first met on a youth basketball team of the same name when they were ten and eleven years old. United by their love of the game and their yearning for companionship, they quickly forged a bond which would carry them through thick and thin (a lot of thin) and, at last, to the brink of a national championship. They were a motley group who faced challenges all too typical of inner-city America. LeBron grew up without a father and had moved with his mother more than a dozen times by the age of 10. Willie McGee, the quiet one, had left both his parents behind in Chicago to be raised by his older brother in Akron. Dru Joyce was outspoken, and his dad, who was ever-present, would end up coaching all five of the boys in high school. Sian Cotton, who also played football, was the happy-go-lucky enforcer, while Romeo Travis was unhappy, bitter, even surly, until he finally opened himself up to the bond his team mates offered. In the summer after seventh grade, the DREAM TEAM tasted glory when they qualified for a national championship tournament in Memphis. But they lost their focus, and had to go home early. They promised each other they would stay together and do whatever it took to win a national title. They had no idea how hard it would be to pursue that promise. In the years that followed, they would endure jealousy, hostility, exploitation, resentment from the black community (because they went to a \"white\" high school), and the consequence of their own over-confidence. Not least, they would all have to wrestle with LeBron's outsize success, which brought too much attention and even a whiff of scandal their way. But together these five boys became men as they sought a national championship.",

With a warrior's heart and an artist's grace, Jordan long ago transcended the sport to become one of the 20th century's global icons.On the court, his almost mythic flair for the spectacular prompted former Los Angeles Laker superstar Magic Johnson to say simply, \"There's Michael, then there's all the rest of us.\"Off the court, Jordan's ability to alter markets and drive the business of his marketing partners is unprecedented.Through it all, Jordan showed the world that greatness, true greatness, comes from the inside out. He remains perhaps the greatest practice player in the history of sports, his desire to improve upon his own example legendary. When critics questioned his all-around ability, he became the game's most dominant defensive player at his position. When teams decided to close down the lane and eliminate drives to the basket, he became a deadly jump shooter. Larry Bird and Magic Johnson had the most successfully teams of the 1980s but never won more than two consecutive championships. The Bulls won three straight--twice.In For the Love of the Game, Jordan takes us through the wonder of his career on the court and away from the game. From the dream that preceded the game-winning shot against Georgetown in the 1982 NCAA Finals to the methodical dissection of the Utah Jazz prior to his game-winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, Jordan pulls back the curtain on one of the most remarkable lives this century.",

    "description": "From the moment these two players took the court on opposing sides, they engaged in a fierce physical and psychological battle. Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s--Celtics vs Lakers, East vs West, physical vs finesse, Old School vs Showtime, even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness--together Bird and Johnson collected 8 NBA Championships, and 6 MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals, but along the way they became lifelong friends.With intimate, fly-on-the-wall detail, When the Game Was Ours transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness, we come to understand Larry's obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young, invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat, not just as a player but as a team leader. We are there the moment he learns he's contracted HIV and hear in his own words how that devastating news impacted his relationships in basketball and beyond. But always, in both cases, we see them prevail.A compelling, up-close-and-personal portrait of basketball's most inimitable duo, When the Game Was Ours is a reevaluation of three decades in counterpoint. It is also a rollicking ride through professional basketball's best times.",

In a sense, the Flex Match-Up Zone takes the very best of the man-to-man techniques and combines them with the best zone principles to form a defense that often times confuses the offense. This defense rotates, or flexes, to take on a different shape every time the ball moves or players positions change. The fact that sometimes it appears as a 1-2-2, other times as a 1-3-1, and still other times as a man-to-man defense, literally takes the offense out of their comfort zone.",

Yet, coaching kids to be ultra-competitive guarantees no greater probability of players becoming successful, well-adjusted members of society when their playing days have ended. Building Good Teammates is the story of how a \u201cMary Poppins-ish\u201d nun inspires Lance Loya to discover an alternative approach to coaching and to explore how his coaching methods were influenced by his unusual childhood and his personal Mount Rushmore\u2014the four men who had the biggest impact on his life. Loya grew up in the iconic Ship Hotel and his adventures in the historic building and the aftermath of the business\u2019s failure caused him to become very calloused and scoped his early coaching style. Through the examination of the virtue of trust, a key component to being a good teammate, he explains how the coaches who impacted his life demonstrated how to have, build, and earn trust. Those three elements coincide with Loya\u2019s three components of a good teammate\u2014care, share, and listen. While teaching kids to be competitive can be beneficial, it is an endeavor that should take a back seat to teaching kids to be good teammates, a more valuable life skill. Everybody is part of a team in some capacity, and the world cannot have too many good teammates. When Sr. Eric Marie, a nearly 80-year old nun, joins Loya\u2019s quest to build good teammates, the practices of the unassuming woman become the basis for the coach\u2019s system. Loya explains how the Sisters of Mercy values of mercy, justice, hospitality, and service can be applied to using sports to teach kids to be good teammates. This book is not an advertisement for organized religion. It is a blueprint for using organized sports to teach kids a viable and sustainable skill that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.",

    "product_name": "Odds-On Basketball Coaching: Crafting High-Percentage Strategies for Game Situations",
    "description": "In basketball, as in most sports, a large part of a coach\u2019s responsibility is to prepare his or her team for games. Yet, little time in practice is typically devoted to readying the players and coaches for specific game situations. For instance, what are the various ways to use dead ball moments to maximum advantage? What adjustments should be made to launch a comeback in particular circumstances? When is it favorable to purposefully miss a foul shot? In Odds-On Basketball Coaching: Crafting High-Percentage Strategies for Game Situations, Michael J. Coffino presents an innovative system for coaches to prepare for specific game scenarios. Coffino challenges coaches to think differently about what they emphasize in practice, placing greater value on preparing for recurring game situations, crafting strategies by assessing the odds, and creating a culture that elevates how players think about the game. Each chapter begins with an actual game scenario that illustrates the chapter\u2019s content and includes discussions of notable college and professional basketball games in order to demonstrate specific points. Odds-On Basketball Coaching provides a framework for making game decisions beyond instincts and habits. It is intended, more than anything, to stimulate coaches and players to think comprehensively and realistically about how to approach games and practices, fostering an environment where everyone can more incisively make game-time decisions. While high school and youth basketball coaches will find this book most helpful, coaches at all levels will benefit from this novel approach to the game.",

But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inside the NBA and CNN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TalkBack Live, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book\u00e2\u0080\u0094and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here\u00e2\u0080\u0094not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEarly on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Washington Post columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him. And that makes him as radically different in these modern celebrity times as a 6-foot-4-inch power forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing Charles Barkley knows, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the crying need for honest, open discussion in this country\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more uncomfortable the subject, the more necessary the dialogue. And if the discussion leader can be as wise, irreverent, (occasionally) profane and (consistently) funny as Charles Barkley, so much the better. Many people are going to be shocked and scandalized by I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It, but many more will stand up and cheer. Like Molly Ivins or Bill O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Reilly, Charles Barkley is utterly his own thinker, and everything he says comes from deep reflection. One way or another, if more blood hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reached your brain by the time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve finished this book, maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been embalmed.",

    "description": "For the countless basketball fans who were spellbound by the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 2003\u20132004 high-wire act, this book is a rare and phenomenal treat. In The Last Season, Lakers coach Phil Jackson draws on his trademark honesty and insight to tell the whole story of the season that proved to be the final ride of a truly great dynasty. From the signing of future Hall-of-Famers Karl Malone and Gary Payton to the Kobe Bryant rape case/media circus, this is a riveting tale of clashing egos, public feuds, contract disputes, and team meltdowns that only a coach, and a writer, of Jackson\u2019s candor, experience, and ability could tell. Full of tremendous human drama and offering lessons on coaching and on life, this is a book that no sports fan can possibly pass up. ",
